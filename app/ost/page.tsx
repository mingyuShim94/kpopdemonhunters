    lyrics: `I was a ghost, I was alone, hah
어두워진, hah, 앞길속에 (Ah)
Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
I was the queen that I'm meant to be
I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
But I couldn't find my own place
Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
But now that's how I'm getting paid, 끝없이 on stage

I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I believe

We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up with our voices
영원히 깨질 수 없는
Gonna be, gonna be golden

Oh, I'm done hidin' now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fear, no lies
That's who we're born to be

Waited so long to break these walls down
To wake up and feel like me
Put these patterns all in the past now
And finally live like the girl they all see

No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong, and I know I believe

We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up, with our voices
영원히 깨질 수 없는
Gonna be, gonna be golden

Oh, I'm done hidin', now I'm shining like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden
We're gonna be, gonna be
Born to be, born to be glowin'
밝게 빛나는 우린
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be`,

    lyrics: `Ugh, you came at a bad time
But you just crossed the line
You wanna get wild?
Okay, I'll show you wild

Better come right, better luck tryin', gettin' to our level
'Cause you might die, never the time, tryna start a battle
Bleeding isn't in my blood, 뼈속부터 달라서
Beating you is what I do, do, do, yeah
Body on body, I'm naughty, not even sorry
And when you pull up, I'll pull up
A little late to the party (Na-na-na-na)
Locked and loaded, I was born for this
There ain't no point in avoiding it
Annoyed? A bit
불을 비춰 다 비켜, 네 앞길을 뺏겨

Knocking you out like a lullaby
Hear that sound ringing in your mind
Better sit down for the show
'Cause I'm gonna show you how it's done, done, done

(Hey) Huntrix don't miss
How it's done, done, done
(Hey) Huntrix don't quit
How it's done, done, done

Run, run, we run the town
Whole world playin' our sound
Turnin' up, it's goin' down
Huntrix show this, how it's done, done, done

Yeah, something about when you come for the crown
That's so humbling, huh?
갑자기 왜 그래? 먼저 건드려, 왜?
이제야 포기해, what?
Nothing to us, run up, you're done up, we come up
From sunup to sundown, so come out to play
Won either way, we're one in a million
We killin', we bring it, you want it? Okay
Heels, nails, blade, mascara
Fit check for my napalm era
Need to beat my face, make it cute and savage
Mirror, mirror on my phone, who's the baddest? (Us, hello?)

Knocking you out like a lullaby
Hear that sound ringing in your mind
Better sit down for the show
'Cause I'm gonna show you (I'm gonna show you)
(I'm gonna show you) How it's done, done, done
I don't talk, but I bite, full of venom (Uh)
Spittin' facts, you know that's
How it's done, done, done
Okay, like, I know I ramble
But when shootin' my words, I go Rambo
Took blood, sweat, and tears, to look natural (Uh)
That's how it's done, done, done

Hear our voice unwavering
'Til our song defeats the night
Makin' fear afraid to breathe
'Til the dark meets the light (How it's done, done, done)

Run, run, we run the town (Done, done, done)
Whole world playin' our sound (Done, done, done)
Turnin' up, it's going down (Done, done, done)
Huntrix, show this how it's done, done, done

We hunt you down, down, down (Down)
We got you now, now, now (Got you now)
We show you how, how, how (Show you how)
Huntrix, don't miss, how it's done, done, done`,

And pour a lot and don't you stop

    lyrics: `Takedown, takedown
Takedown, down, down, down (HUNTR/X girls to the world)
Takedown, down, down, down (It's a takedown)

So sweet, so easy on the eyes, but hideous on the inside
Whole life spreading lies, but you can't hide, baby, nice try
I'm 'bout to switch up these vibes, I finally opened my eyes
It's time to kick you straight back into the night

'Cause I see your real face and it's ugly as sin
Time to put you in your place 'cause you're rotten within
When your patterns start to show
It makes the hatred wanna grow outta my veins

I don't think you're ready for the takedown
Break you into pieces in a world of pain 'cause you're all the same
Yeah, it's a takedown
A demon with no feelings, don't deserve to live, it's so obvious

I'ma gear up and take you down (Oh)
Da-da-da, down
It's a takedown (Oh)
Da-da-da, down
I'ma take it down (Oh)
Da-da-da, down
It's a takedown (Oh)
Da-da-da, down (Take it down)

It's a takedown, I'ma take you out, you break down like, "What?"
It's a takedown, I'ma take you out and I ain't gonna stop
정신을 놓고 널 짓밟고 칼을 새겨놔
You'll be beggin' and cryin', all of you dyin', never miss my shot

When your patterns start to show
It makes the hatred wanna grow out of my veins

I don't think you're ready for the takedown
당당하게 어둠 앞에 다가서 다 무너뜨려

I'ma take it down (Oh, watch me do it, yeah)
Da-da-da, down (Ooh)
It's a takedown (Oh)
Da-da-da, down (Ooh)

Oh, you're the master of illusion
나를 속이려 하지마
Look at all the masses that you're foolin'
But they'll turn on you soon, so how?
How can you sleep or live with yourself?
A broken soul trapped in a nastiest shell
영혼 없는 네 목숨을 끊으러 and watch you die
You can try but you can't hide

It's a takedown, I'ma take you out, you break down like, "What?"
It's a takedown, I'ma take you out and I ain't gonna stop
I'ma cut you open, lose control, then rip out your heart
You'll be beggin' and cryin', all of you dyin'

I'ma gear up and take you down (Oh)
Da-da-da, down (Ah)
It's a takedown (Oh)
Da-da-da, down (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)

I tried to sing, couldn't hit the notes
The words kept catching in my throat
I tried to smile, I was suffocating though
But here with you, I can finally breathe
You say you're no good, but you're good for me
I've been hoping to change, now I know we can change
But I won't if you're not by my side

Why does it feel right every time I let you in?
Why does it feel like I can tell you anything?
All the secrets that keep me in chains and
All the damage that might make me dangerous
You got a dark side, guess you're not the only one
What if we both tried fighting what we're running from?
We can't fix it if we never face it
What if we find a way to escape it?

We could be free
Free
We can't fix it if we never face it
Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless

Ooh, time goes by, and I lose perspective
Yeah, hope only hurts, so I just forget it
But you're breaking through all the dark in me
When I thought that nobody could
And you're waking up all these parts of me
That I thought were buried for good

Between imposter and this monster
I been lost inside my head
Ain't no choice when all these voices
Keep me pointing towards no end
It's just easy when I'm with you
No one sees me the way you do
I don't trust it, but I want to
I keep coming back to

Why does it feel right every time I let you in?
Why does it feel like I can tell you anything?
We can't fix it if we never face it
What if we find a way to escape it?

We could be free
Free
We can't fix it if we never face it
Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless
Oh, so take my hand, it's open
Free, free
What if we heal what's broken?
Free, free

I tried to hide, but something broke
I couldn't sing, but you give me hope
We can't fix it if we never face it
Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless`,

Nothing but the proof of what I am
The worst of what I came from, patterns I'm ashamed of
Things that even I don't understand
I tried to fix it, I tried to fight it
My head was twisted, my heart divided
My lies all collided
I don't know why I didn't trust you to be on my side

I broke into a million pieces, and I can't go back
But now I'm seeing all the beauty in the broken glass
The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony
My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
Why did I cover up the colors stuck inside my head?
I should've let the jagged edges meet the light instead
Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony
The song we couldn't write, this is what it sounds like

We're shattering the silence, we're rising defiant
Shouting in the quiet, you're not alone
We listened to the demons, we let them get between us
But none of us are out here on our own
So, we were cowards, so, we were liars
So, we're not heroes, we're still survivors
The dreamers, the fighters, no lying, I'm tired
But dive in the fire and I'll be right here by your side

We broke into a million pieces, and we can't go back
But now we're seeing all the beauty in the broken glass
The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony
My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
Why did we cover up the colors stuck inside our head?
Get up and let the jagged edges meet the light instead
Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony
Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like

(Oh, oh, oh) Hey, hey
This is what it sounds like
(Oh, oh, oh) Hey, hey
This is what it sounds like

But now I'm seeing all the beauty in the broken glass
The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony
My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
Why did we cover up the colors stuck inside our head?
Get up and let the jagged edges meet the light instead
Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony
Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like

My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like
Truth after all this time, our voices all combined
When darkness meets the light, this is what it sounds like`,
