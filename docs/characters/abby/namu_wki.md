### **1. Overview**

> "I knew they would. That one's always looking at me."

Abby is a character in _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is the main dancer, lead rapper, and sub-vocalist for the demon idol group, Saja Boys.

He is the group's archetypal muscular member, known for his six-pack abs. His stage name, "Abby," is a direct reference to the English word "abs." This has led to numerous jokes among Korean viewers, as "Abby" (애비) is a homophone for an old, informal term for "father," leading to gags about him and his bandmate, Baby. While the name Abby is common in Western countries (usually as a nickname for Abigail or Albert), its use for a male K-pop idol in Korea is seen as comically awkward.

### **2. In-Story Arc**

**(Warning: Spoilers Ahead)**

While his position as main dancer might suggest a smaller role in the group's songs, Abby has several standout moments on stage. In "Soda Pop," he leads a key dance break in the first verse and also has a part in the chorus. In "Your Idol," his singing part is brief (only 9.8 seconds, or 7.8% of the song, compared to Jinu's 70.6 seconds), but his performance is unforgettable. His "gat-kkeun performance"—a dance move involving the string of his traditional Korean hat (_gat_)—was so impactful that viewers nicknamed him "the gat-string guy." This move was highly praised by a real-life traditional Korean dancer for its innovation, who noted they planned to study and incorporate it into their own performances.

Despite the Saja Boys' story focusing heavily on Jinu, Abby receives a fair share of the spotlight through these memorable scenes and his interactions with the other characters. He is often seen alongside Jinu in group shots and shares a significant connection with Mira. His unique fan service, such as giving out pencil rubbings of his abs, and his iconic dance moves have made him a fan-favorite among the Saja Boys.

In a parody of the variety show _Weekly Idol_, Abby is seen giving his bandmate Baby a piggyback ride as they flee from HUNTR/X, further fueling the "Abby the daddy" jokes among fans.

### **3. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **Name and Motif:** His name is derived from "abs," and he shamelessly flaunts his physique throughout the film. He is a "popcorn maker" for Mira and Zoey, and at a fansign, he even gives out frottage art of his abs. His outfits are consistently cropped to show off his midsection. According to the production team, his 3D model was designed with 20% more muscle mass than the other members. His occult motif is believed to be the _dokkaebi_ (Korean goblin), a mythological being known for its powerful masculine energy.

- **Real-Life Parallel:** His muscular idol image has drawn comparisons to former Monsta X member Wonho, who in turn cosplayed as Abby.

- **Combat Prowess:** Despite his impressive physique, his combat skills are questionable. While the Saja Boys (excluding Jinu) were shown to be stronger than average demons, they were still no match for the hunters. In the final battle, Abby is swiftly defeated by Mira in a 2-on-1 fight without landing a single effective blow.

- **Final Moments & Fan Reception:** In a testament to his defining trait, Mira's finishing blow is a slash directly across his abs. Her cry of "No more abs!" is iconic. However, in some dubs, her line is more regretful, such as the Japanese "Farewell, my beloved abs!" or the French "Adieu, abs!" delivered in a tearful voice. This is likely a reference to the fact that Mira's eyes were "making popcorn" even as she defeated him. He is the only Saja Boys member besides Jinu to get a small scene in the end credits, shown doing ab workouts with the three auntie characters.
