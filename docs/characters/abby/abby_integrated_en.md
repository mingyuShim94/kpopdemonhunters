### **1. Overview**

Abby Saja is a supporting antagonist in **_K-Pop Demon Hunters_**. He is the main dancer, lead rapper, and sub-vocalist of the demon idol group, Saja Boys. As a demon disguised as a K-pop idol, his mission is to help steal fans from the hunter group HUNTR/X to weaken the protective Honmoon barrier.

His stage name, "Abby," is derived from the English word "abs," and true to his name, he is the group's designated muscular member, renowned for his well-defined physique.

### **2. Appearance**

Abby is a tall (185 cm) man with an athletic, muscular build, famous for his six-pack abs. In his human disguise, he has lightly tanned skin, short raspberry-pink hair, and brown eyes. In his true demon form, his skin turns purple with glowing patterns, and he has claws, sharp teeth, and golden eyes.

As an idol, he favors outfits that show off his midsection, often wearing cropped shirts, beanies, and ripped skinny jeans. During the "Your Idol" performance, he combines modern and traditional styles, wearing a fishnet crop top and leather pants under a traditional Korean overcoat (_sochangui_) and _gat_.

### **3. Personality**

Abby is portrayed as the group's "eye candy," exuding confidence with a teasing and occasionally vain demeanor. He frequently flaunts his physique to provoke reactions from others, such as proudly distributing pencil rubbings of his own abs at a fan signing event. He is also self-aware, correctly guessing that Mira and Zoey's attraction to him was the reason HUNTR/X followed them into a bathhouse.

Like the other Saja Boys, he can be aggressive, but his actual combat effectiveness is questionable. In his final confrontation with Mira, he opts to pose and flash his abs rather than attack, a fatal miscalculation that leads to his demise.

### **4. In-Story Arc & Significance**

**Backstory:** While his past is largely unknown, it is assumed that he was once human and became a demon through a deal with Gwi-ma.

**Present:** Abby is introduced when Jinu proposes the plan to form a demon K-pop group. During their debut in the human world, his shirt dramatically bursts open, revealing his abs and leaving a strong impression on Mira and Zoey.

Throughout the film, he participates in various idol activities, including competing on a variety show and hijacking a HUNTR/X fan event. At the fansign, he sits next to Mira, provides his unique "ab frottage" autographs, and becomes part of the fan-created "Miromabby" love triangle ship with Mira and Romance. Despite appearing touched by fan gifts, he callously discards them afterward.

His final appearance is at the Saja Boys' Namsan Tower concert. After Jinu's sacrifice, Abby attempts to attack HUNTR/X but is swiftly killed by Mira, who slashes him across the stomach while declaring, "No more abs!"

Although the main plot revolves around Jinu, Abby stands out with his memorable character traits and performances. His iconic **"gat-kkeun performance"** (a dance move using the string of his hat) in "Your Idol" was highly praised and earned him the fan nickname "the gat-string guy."

### **5. Abilities and Skills**

- **Demonic Powers:** He possesses standard demon abilities, including soul stealing, teleportation, levitation, and shapeshifting.
- **Immortality:** He is effectively immortal unless killed by a hunter or Gwi-ma.
- **Idol Talents:** As the main dancer, he is an exceptional performer with proficient singing and rapping skills.
- **Unique Ability:** He has the bizarre power to turn a person's eyes into corn (which then becomes popcorn), as demonstrated on Zoey.

### **6. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **3D Model:** All Saja Boys members share a base 3D model, but Abby's was exclusively modified to have 20% more muscle mass.
- **Name Puns:** His name "Abby" (애비) is a homophone for an old, informal Korean word for "father," leading to many jokes among viewers, especially in relation to his bandmate, Baby.
- **Symbolism:** His character can be seen as a commentary on the sexualization and objectification of K-pop idols.
- **Occult Motif:** His motif is believed to be the _dokkaebi_ (Korean goblin), a mythological figure known for its strength and masculine energy.
- **Real-Life Parallel:** His muscular idol image drew comparisons to former Monsta X member Wonho, who later cosplayed as Abby.
- **On-Screen Death:** He is the only member of the Saja Boys, besides Jinu, to have a confirmed, on-screen death.
