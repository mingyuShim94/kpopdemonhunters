### **1. Overview**

Abby Saja is the main dancer of the Saja Boys and serves as a minor antagonist in the film _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is a demon who disguises himself as a K-pop idol to steal fans from the demon-hunting girl group HUNTR/X as part of a plan to weaken the protective Honmoon barrier. He is voiced by Sungwon Cho, with Neckwav providing his singing voice.

### **2. Appearance**

Abby is a tall man with an athletic physique, most known for his well-defined abdominal muscles. He has an oval-shaped face, high cheekbones, and a prominent jawline. In his human disguise, he has lightly tanned skin, short raspberry pink hair, and brown eyes. His nails are manicured with black, pink, and yellow designs. In his demon form, he has purple skin with glowing patterns, clawed hands, sharp teeth, and golden eyes.

As an idol, Abby typically wears beanies, button-up shirts, and ripped skinny jeans. In his true demon form, he wears traditional Korean clothing, including a tattered black _hanbok_ and a _gat_. During the "Your Idol" performance, he combines these styles, wearing a fishnet crop top and leather pants under a traditional overcoat.

### **3. Personality**

Abby is portrayed as the "eye candy" of the group, with a confident and teasing demeanor. He often shows off his physique to provoke reactions, a behavior that sometimes borders on vanity. For example, at a fan signing event, he proudly distributed signed pencil rubbings of his own abs. However, he is also self-aware, correctly guessing that HUNTR/X followed the Saja Boys into a bathhouse because Mira and Zoey were attracted to him.

Like the other Saja Boys, Abby can be aggressive, being one of the first to attack the hunters after Jinu's sacrifice. However, his combat effectiveness is questionable. In his final confrontation, he simply poses and flashes his abs at Mira, expecting to distract her, which ultimately leads to his demise.

### **4. Plot**

**Backstory:** Not much is known about Abby's early life. It is assumed that he was once human and was transformed into a demon after making a deal with the demon king, Gwi-Ma.

**Main Events:** Abby first appears in the Demon Realm when Jinu proposes the plan to form a K-pop boy band to defeat the demon hunters. As a member of the newly formed Saja Boys, Abby makes his human world debut in an alleyway, where his shirt bursts open, revealing his abs and causing strong reactions from Mira and Zoey.

He later competes on a variety show, flees from HUNTR/X into a men's bathhouse, and reports the group's success to Gwi-Ma in the Demon Realm, looking visibly exhausted. After gaining more popularity, the Saja Boys hijack a HUNTR/X fan event. Abby sits next to Mira, offers fans autographed "frottage" art of his abs, and playfully bickers with Mira and Romance, which sparks the "Miromabby" ship among fans. Despite appearing touched by fan gifts, he discards them in the trash immediately after the event.

In his final appearance, Abby performs "Your Idol" with the Saja Boys in their demon forms. After Jinu sacrifices himself, Abby attempts to attack HUNTR/X but is swiftly killed by Mira, who slashes him across the abdomen while declaring, "No more abs!"

### **5. Abilities and Skills**

- **Demonic Powers:** As a demon, Abby can steal souls, teleport, levitate, and use illusion magic to switch between his human and demon forms.
- **Immortality:** He is effectively immortal, unless killed by a demon hunter or Gwi-Ma.
- **Artistic Talents:** As the main dancer of the Saja Boys, he is an exceptional dancer and a proficient singer.
- **Turning Girl's Eyes into Corn:** He is shown to have this unusual ability, which he uses on Zoey during their first encounter.
