# Abby (Ïï†ÎπÑ)

> **"It's not 'daddy,' it's Abby!"**

**Abby** is a major antagonist in the animated film **K-Pop: Demon Hunters**. He is the main dancer, lead rapper, and sub-vocalist of the demon K-pop group, the **Saja Boys**. His stage name, "Abby," is a direct reference to his well-defined abs, which are a central part of his character design and appeal. Despite his demonic nature, he often comes across as more of a comic relief figure, with his name and physique being the subject of numerous jokes both in-universe and among fans.

## üìñ Story

Abby's backstory is not explored in detail, but like the other Saja Boys, he is a demon from the Joseon era, now serving the Demon King, Gwi-Ma. His primary role is to use his powerful dance performances and stage presence to help the group steal souls.

His name is a running gag. While derived from "abs," it's a homonym for the informal Korean word for "daddy" (ÏïÑÎπÑ), and it's also a common female name in English-speaking countries. This leads to constant jokes, with fans and even other characters commenting on the "dumb" or "confusing" nature of his name.

Abby's physique is his defining trait. He is almost always seen in outfits that show off his abs, such as crop tops. In one memorable scene, the buttons on his Hawaiian shirt burst off due to his flexing, and at a fan signing event, he even makes a pencil rubbing of his abs for a fan.

Despite being a dancer, he gets a decent amount of screen time and lines. He has a notable dance break in "Soda Pop" and delivers the memorable "gat-kkeun" (Í∞ìÎÅà, traditional hat string) performance in "Your Idol," which earned him the nickname "Í∞ìÎÅàÍ±î" (the hat string guy) from viewers.

He is most often seen with the group's leader, Jinu, and has a significant on-screen dynamic with Mira of HUNTR/X, leading to the fan-created "Miromabby" love triangle ship (Mira + Romance + Abby).

His demise is one of the most talked-about scenes. Mira defeats him by slicing her sword along the lines of his abs, causing his eyes to pop into popcorn, just as they did when she first saw his physique.
