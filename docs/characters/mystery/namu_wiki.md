### **1. Overview**

> "And to our fans, thank you. We really feed off your energy."

Mystery is a character in _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is a member of the demon idol group, Saja Boys, and is presumed to be the group's sub-vocalist. True to his stage name, his face is a mystery, as it is almost entirely obscured by his long bangs throughout the film.

### **2. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **Defining Traits & Motif:** His most prominent feature is his face-concealing hairstyle. This design choice was also practical, as it streamlined the animation process by reducing the need for detailed facial animation. When he first transforms into his idol form, his long, sharp fangs are shown morphing into earrings. This, combined with his tendency to growl at fans, suggests his true form is that of a beast-type demon. Fans have debated his specific motif:

  - **Sapsali Dog Theory:** This is the majority view. The Sapsali is a native Korean dog breed known for its long fur covering its eyes. His gentle appearance but wild nature, his dog-like growling, and his periwinkle hair color—similar to the "blue" Sapsali—all support this theory.
  - **Jangsanbeom Theory:** A minority view suggests he is a Jangsanbeom, a fearsome Korean cryptid. This is based on the argument that a Sapsali, a guardian spirit, is an unfitting motif for a high-ranking demon. His glowing blue eyes, long white/blue-ish fur, and beautiful singing voice are all traits associated with the Jangsanbeom.

- **Story Significance & Fan Reception:** Mystery has very little story significance, even among the other Saja Boys who are already minor characters. However, he serves as the primary love interest for Zoey, who is immediately smitten with him. Their ship is canonically named "Zoeystery." He is the only member to be part of a purely romantic pairing, as Rumi and Jinu's bond is more about shared trauma, and Mira's "interest" in Abby is purely physical. Because of this, he has gained a significant following.

- **On-Stage Presence:** While he doesn't have many lines, his beautiful, falsetto singing voice has been highly praised. Most of his singing parts are duets with Romance.

- **Final Moments:** In the final battle, Zoey strikes him, and his bangs are momentarily swept aside, revealing his full face to her alone. Her reaction—"He's totally my type!"—confirms his attractiveness. However, she proceeds to attack him anyway, though a puff of smoke implies he may have teleported away at the last second, leaving his fate ambiguous.

- **Personality and Habits:** He has a signature pose where he holds one arm. His only speaking line in the entire film is his thank-you message to fans, which has a sinister double meaning: "We really feed off your energy." At a fansign, he growls at fans like a dog, prompting Zoey to scold him by tapping his head with a pen, to which he reacts with a slight sulk.

- **Group Hierarchy:** Despite Baby being the _maknae_, official character model sheets reveal that Mystery is the shortest member of the Saja Boys.

- **Japanese Dub:** In the Japanese dub, he uses the personal pronoun "boku."
