### **1. Overview**

Mystery Saja is the lead vocalist of the Saja Boys and serves as a minor antagonist in the film _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is a demon in disguise who poses as a K-pop idol to steal fans from the demon-hunting girl group HUNTR/X. He also briefly serves as a love interest for HUNTR/X member Zoey. He is voiced by Alan Lee, with Kevin Woo providing his singing voice.

### **2. Appearance**

Mystery is a man of average height with a slim build. His most distinctive feature is his long, periwinkle-colored hair with bangs that completely cover his eyes. Though much of his face is obscured, he appears to have a small nose and a soft jawline. In his demon form, he has purple skin with glowing patterns, clawed hands, sharp teeth, and hidden tusks.

As an idol, Mystery wears stylish clothing, including sweater vests over sleeveless turtlenecks and ripped skinny jeans. He paints his nails purple. In his true demon form, he wears a tattered black _hanbok_ and a _gat_. During the "Your Idol" performance, he blends these styles, wearing a crewneck shirt and asymmetrical pants under a traditional overcoat.

### **3. Personality**

Mystery is portrayed as the most enigmatic member of the Saja Boys. He maintains a reserved and stoic persona, striking bashful poses and remaining mostly silent during public appearances. He rarely shows emotion, with rare exceptions like a faint smile or a single tear during a spicy food challenge.

Despite his idol persona, Mystery struggles to convincingly mimic human behavior. His movements are sometimes rigid, and he exhibits unexpected animalistic traits, such as barking at a fan without provocation during a signing event.

Beneath the surface, he is an immoral demon who willingly serves Gwi-Ma. Off-stage, he appears apathetic and tired of his idol duties. Like the other Saja Boys, he becomes aggressive when their plans start to fail, being the first to charge at HUNTR/X after Jinu's sacrifice.

### **4. Plot**

**Backstory:** Little is known about Mystery's past. It is assumed that he was once human and was transformed into a demon after making a pact with the demon king, Gwi-Ma.

**Main Events:** Mystery first appears in the Demon Realm when Jinu proposes the plan to form a K-pop boy band. As a member of the Saja Boys, he makes his debut in the human world, quickly capturing the attention of Zoey. He competes on a variety show, flees from HUNTR/X, and reports the group's success to Gwi-Ma, looking visibly exhausted.

During a joint fan signing event, Zoey flirts with him, and he later barks at a fan, only to be reprimanded by Zoey. Like the other members, he discards fan gifts in the trash after the event.

In his final appearance, Mystery performs "Your Idol" in his demon form. When HUNTR/X reunites, he attacks the girls and engages in a brief fight with Zoey. After Jinu's sacrifice, he is the first to charge at the hunters but ultimately escapes by teleporting away just as Zoey delivers a final blow. She is the only one to catch a glimpse of his uncovered face before he vanishes.

### **5. Abilities and Skills**

- **Demonic Powers:** As a demon, Mystery can steal souls, teleport, levitate, and shapeshift between his human and demon forms.
- **Immortality:** He is effectively immortal, unless killed by a demon hunter or Gwi-Ma.
- **Singing:** As the lead vocalist, he has an exceptionally angelic voice and can hit unusually high notes.
- **Artistic Talents:** He is a proficient dancer.
