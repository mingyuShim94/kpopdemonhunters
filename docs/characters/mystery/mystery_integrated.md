## üìñ Story

Almost nothing is known about Mystery's past life or how he became a demon, making him the most enigmatic member of the Saja Boys. His defining characteristic is his shyness, which is a facade for a sly and sometimes aggressive personality. He rarely speaks, and when he does, his words are often double-edged, like thanking fans for their energy, which he literally feeds on.

His animalistic nature is hinted at during a fan signing event where he growls and barks at a fan before being chided by **Zoey** of **HUNTR/X**. This has led to fan theories that he might be the spirit of a beast, with the most popular theory being that he is a **Sapsali** (ÏÇΩÏÇ¥Í∞ú), a shaggy Korean dog breed known for dispelling evil spirits. This is supported by his hairstyle, his growling, and the fact that his canine teeth are prominent in his demon form.

Mystery harbors a particular animosity towards Zoey, being the first to attack her in the final battle. This is ironic, given that Zoey has a very obvious and one-sided crush on him. Despite her open dislike for the Saja Boys, she is consistently flustered and charmed by Mystery's presence. This dynamic has made the **"Zoeystery"** pairing a fan favorite.

Like the other Saja Boys, he is defeated in the final battle against HUNTR/X.
