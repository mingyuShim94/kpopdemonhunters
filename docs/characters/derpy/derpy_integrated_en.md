Of course. Here is the final, comprehensive English profile for the character Derpy, combining all the details from both source documents.

### **Derpy**

#### **1. Overview**

Derpy is a mascot character and the ultimate "scene-stealer" in _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is a supernatural creature, a former pet of Jinu, who resembles a large, comical tiger from traditional Korean folk paintings (_minhwa_).

Unlike the reddish demons, Derpy has a blue color scheme, associating him more with the hunters. His official name was confirmed by designer Radford Sechrist to be **Derpy**, a name derived from the internet meme "Derp," which refers to a silly, cross-eyed expression. This is a nod to the fact that tigers in _Kkachi Horangi_ paintings are often depicted with crossed eyes.

#### **2. Appearance**

Derpy is a large, supernatural feline with cerulean blue fur. His upper body is covered in black and white stripes, while his chest features rosette patterns. His eyes have a yellow cornea and red irises and are perpetually unfocused, giving him his signature "derpy" look. He sports a constant grin with sharp white teeth and has tusk-like fangs poking out from the corners of his mouth.

#### **3. Personality and In-Story Arc**

Derpy is a friendly, loyal, and affectionate creature, though he is also quite dim-witted. He behaves much like a common housecat, enjoying being petted. His most defining trait is a unique obsession: he feels an overwhelming compulsion to set any knocked-over object upright. This is his top priority, and he will ignore all else to try and fix a fallen flowerpot or trash can, though his chubby paws always cause him to fail.

He is introduced in a menacing way, but his comical obsession with a flowerpot he knocks over immediately reveals his harmless nature. Initially, he serves as a messenger between Jinu and Rumi. He quickly grows comfortable with Rumi, sleeping in her room and even acting as her mount.

He is a neutral being who does not interfere in the conflict between hunters and demons. However, he shows deep affection for those he cares about. In a moment of heartbreak, he tries to stop Jinu from betraying Rumi by presenting him with the bracelet she had given him, his usually blank face filled with sadness.

#### **4. Nature and Abilities**

According to the art director, Derpy is a **"good spirit or yokai that can exist in any space."** He is not a demon and is one of the only non-demon supernatural creatures in the film. This allows him to remain in the human world even after the Honmoon barrier is restored. He is shown to travel between realms by phasing through the ground or using the Honmoon as a medium. A setting detail reveals that Jinu summons him by striking a _haetae_ (a mythical guardian lion) statue. When he moves, a distinct creaking bamboo sound can be heard.

#### **5. Trivia and Background**

- **Motif:** His primary motif is the tiger from the Korean folk art style known as **_Kkachi Horangi_** (or _Hojakdo_), which depicts magpies and tigers. True to the protective symbolism of these paintings, he is shown scaring away lesser demons with a growl. His ability to appear and disappear at will, combined with his grin, also draws inspiration from the **Cheshire Cat** in _Alice in Wonderland_.
- **Immense Popularity:** His cute, dog-like behavior and goofy appearance made him an instant fan favorite, leading to a flood of fanart and high demand for merchandise. Similar tiger-themed goods from the National Museum of Korea sold out quickly after the film's release.
- **Spy Theory (Debunked):** A fan theory suggested Derpy might have been a spy for Jinu, looking at discarded lyrics in Rumi's trash can. However, the production team has consistently described him as a "good spirit," making it more likely that Jinu exploited his innocent nature.
