## üìñ Story

Derpy first appears as a potential threat, mistaken by Rumi for an enemy attacker. However, the misunderstanding is quickly cleared when Derpy clumsily knocks over a flowerpot and then obsessively, and unsuccessfully, tries to set it upright with his chubby paws. This endearing moment reveals his true nature: a harmless, slightly obsessive-compulsive spirit.

Throughout the film, Derpy's main role is to act as a messenger between Jinu and Rumi, carrying letters in his mouth. He is a being of pure innocence, often seen napping in Rumi's room or simply existing peacefully in the human world, even when other spirits are banished back to the underworld. According to the art director, Derpy is a "good yokai" or spirit who can exist in any realm. He appears to use the Honmoon (spirit gates) as portals, effortlessly moving between spaces.

While he is mostly portrayed as cute and goofy, an early scene shows him terrifying other demons with glowing red eyes and a menacing growl, hinting at a powerful, protective nature. This aligns with the traditional belief that *hojakdo* (tiger and magpie paintings) were used to ward off evil spirits.

By the end of the film, Derpy has become so popular that Zoey is seen wearing a shirt with his face on it, cementing his status as a beloved icon.

## ‚ú® Trivia

*   Derpy's name comes from the internet slang term "derp," which refers to a goofy, cross-eyed expression. This is a nod to the fact that tigers in traditional *kkachi horangi* folk paintings are often depicted with crossed eyes.
*   He is the film's official mascot and most popular character, sparking a massive wave of fan art and merchandise requests upon the movie's release.
*   Before official merchandise was available, fans flocked to buy traditional Korean folk art goods featuring similar tiger designs, such as pins from the National Museum of Korea.
*   His design was influenced by the **Cheshire Cat** from *Alice in Wonderland* and was initially considered as a reference for the main villain, Gwi-Ma.
*   While never named in the film (Jinu just calls him "Tiger"), his name was confirmed by designer Radford Sechrist.
