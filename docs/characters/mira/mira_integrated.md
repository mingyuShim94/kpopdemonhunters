## 📖 Story

Mira grew up in a conservative, wealthy family where she was considered the "black sheep" due to her rebellious nature, fiery pink hair, and blunt attitude. While her family didn't disown her, their disapproval is a source of deep-seated insecurity for her. This complex family dynamic shaped her into a person who appears tough and aggressive on the surface but is secretly vulnerable and craves acceptance.

She found her true family in **HUNTR/X**, where her aggressive tendencies became assets in their secret lives as demon hunters. As the group's choreographer, she is the creative force behind their iconic dance moves. However, her insecurities often lead to friction, particularly with Rumi. Mira's frustration with Rumi's secrecy and perceived lack of self-esteem causes her to lash out, creating a rift between them.

This conflict comes to a head when Rumi's half-demon heritage is publicly revealed. Feeling betrayed and confused, Mira is momentarily swayed by the Demon King, Gwi-Ma. However, when Rumi finds her voice again—both literally and figuratively—Mira is the first to break free from the demon's influence and rejoin her friend. Together, they lead the charge to defeat Gwi-Ma, mending their friendship in the process.
