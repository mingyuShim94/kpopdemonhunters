### **1. Overview**

> "Fit check for my napalm era."
> — Mira's opening line in "How It's Done"

Mira is the deuteragonist of **_K-Pop Demon Hunters_**. She is the main dancer, visual, and choreographer of the world-renowned K-pop girl group HUNTR/X. As the tallest member, she is known for her striking looks and exceptional dancing skills. Growing up as a "problem child," she secretly believes she is unworthy of having a family or friends. Alongside her groupmates Rumi and Zoey, she leads a double life as a demon hunter, wielding a **Gok-do**—a curved sword inspired by ancient Korean blades—in combat.

### **2. Personality**

Mira embodies the "girl crush" archetype with a tough exterior, characterized by her blunt, sarcastic, and brutally honest nature. She has no problem calling out her friends with deadpan remarks but is fiercely protective of Rumi and Zoey, whom she considers her true family. This bond is especially important to her, as it contrasts sharply with the relationship she has with her biological family, who treated her as an outcast. She has a quick temper, which flares up when provoked by demons or uncomfortable fan "ships."

Functioning as the group's anchor, she balances Rumi's insecurities and Zoey's naivety. Though she often appears stoic, she is not afraid to be goofy and energetic with her friends.

Calling herself an "expert at reading people," Mira is highly observant and is the first to notice Rumi's strange behavior. When Rumi's actions become incomprehensible, Mira's frustration stems from a deep-seated fear of losing her friend. Initially, she shows no mercy to demons, having been taught they are all evil. However, her entire belief system is challenged when she discovers Rumi is part-demon. This forces her to grow, ultimately choosing to accept the friend she knows rather than cling to the dogma she was taught.

At the core of her tough personality is **low self-esteem**. A family photo reveals her as a rebellious figure in what appears to be a conservative family, and her central conflict revolves around this strained relationship. Her deepest insecurities are targeted by the demon king Gwi-ma, who taunts her with the words, "Thought you finally had a family? You're not worthy."

### **3. Skills and Abilities**

- **Demon Hunter:** Mira is a skilled demon hunter alongside her bandmates.

  - **Combat Style:** She specializes in mid-range combat, using her height and the long reach of her Gok-do to fight multiple enemies. As the group's vanguard, she charges into battle with Zoey and can unleash an area-of-effect attack, leading some to believe she has the highest raw physical power in the group.
  - **Spirit Magic:** As a Hunter, she can use spirit magic to conjure her weapon and create energy barriers, empowered by her own soul and the souls of their fans.
  - **Mediumship:** She can see spirits, demons, and the spiritual energy of the Honmoon, allowing her to detect demonic presences or weaknesses in the barrier.

- **Choreography:** While all members are skilled dancers, Mira is the group's lead dancer and official choreographer.

- **Dart Throwing:** She demonstrates exceptional accuracy by casually hitting a poster of Jinu with three darts thrown over her head.

### **4. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **Inspiration:** Director Maggie Kang revealed that Mira's look was inspired by Korean model **Ahn So-yeon**.
- **Design History:** In early concept art, Mira's hairstyle was different, and her weapon was originally intended to be a fan. Storyboards also suggest she was once conceived as a character who always wore glasses, a popular look she sports with her casual outfits.
- **Age:** She is six months younger than Rumi.
- **Role in Group:** It is implied that Mira handles choreography while Zoey is the primary lyricist.
- **Devotion:** Having been alienated from her biological family, Mira treasures HUNTR/X as her found family. This is symbolized by her _norigae_ (tassel pendant), which features charms representing Rumi and Zoey.
- **Fan Culture:** In the film, fans "ship" her with Saja Boys members Romance and Abby. She particularly despises the polyamorous ship "Miromabby."
- **Voice Actor's Insight:** Her Korean voice actress, Kim Do-young, felt a personal connection to a scene where Mira wears cute pajamas, interpreting it as Mira hiding a softer side beneath her tough image.
- **Fan Appeal:** Her "reversal charm"—a tough exterior hiding a deeply devoted and caring heart (a tsundere-like quality)—has made her a fan favorite.
- **Idol Reference:** A lead designer mentioned that **Hwasa of Mamamoo** was an inspiration for HUNTR/X, and fans believe Mira's fierce and confident image reflects Hwasa's the most.
