### **1. Overview**

> "Fit check for my napalm era."
> — Mira's opening line in "How It's Done"

Mira is the deuteragonist of _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. She is the main dancer and visual of the world-renowned K-pop group HUNTR/X. As the tallest member of the group, she is known for her slender figure and exceptional dancing skills. Her primary weapon is a _Gok-do_, a curved sword inspired by blades from the ancient Gaya confederacy of Korea.

### **2. Abilities**

As a Hunter, Mira specializes in mid-range combat, utilizing her height and the long reach of her _Gok-do_ to engage multiple enemies simultaneously. She often acts as the group's vanguard alongside Zoey, charging into battle first. With a single powerful swing, she can cut down several demons at once. She has also demonstrated the ability to unleash an area-of-effect attack by striking the ground with her stored energy, leading some to believe she may possess the highest raw physical power in HUNTR/X.

### **3. Personality**

Mira embodies the "girl crush" archetype common in K-pop, characterized by a defiant and brutally honest attitude. She is said to be so bold that she would wear a sleeping bag to the Met Gala. This rebellious persona is very popular with fans, who are shown imitating her signature crossed-arms pose and sharp-eyed glare.

However, beneath this tough exterior, Mira struggles with low self-esteem. This is a common trope where a strong personality is used to hide deep-seated insecurities. When Rumi points this out during an argument, Mira is left speechless. Upon discovering Rumi's half-demon secret, her reaction is not anger but self-pity, remarking, "I knew it was too good to be true." When Gwi-ma's whispers tempt her, she utters the self-deprecating line, "Who was I kidding, thinking I could have a family?"

While Rumi's conflict is about her species and Zoey's is about her identity, Mira's central conflict revolves around her family. A family photo shows her as the sole rebellious figure in a conservative-looking family. It's implied through the lyrics of their song "Golden" that her clashing personality led to discord at home. Gwi-ma's taunts—"Thought you finally had a family? You're not worthy. You never were"—further confirm this painful history. There is also a fan theory that she may come from a wealthy family, as the "Golden" music video depicts her family looking displeased with her pop-star success, a common trope for a self-made star rebelling against their family's wishes.

### **4. In-Story Arc**

**(Warning: Spoilers Ahead)**

Once the "problem child" of her family, Mira found her place as a member of HUNTR/X under Celine's guidance. Though she appears chic and aloof, she cherishes Rumi and Zoey as the true family she never had.

The film opens with HUNTR/X defeating demons on their private jet and making a spectacular landing on stage. Here, Mira delivers her iconic line, "Fit check for my napalm era," a phrase that encapsulates her intense, self-assured image. After the show, her hopes for a well-deserved rest are crushed when Rumi unilaterally announces their next single, "Golden," causing Mira to wail in genuine despair.

In the "Golden" music video, her lyrics reflect on her past: "Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild / But now that's how I'm getting paid." When Rumi's vocal issues cancel a live show, Mira comforts her. At a traditional clinic, she protectively glares down the healer to stop him from prying into Rumi's (and her own) vulnerabilities. Later, she and Zoey have a comical "popcorn eyes" reaction to Saja Boys member Abby's abs.

When the group decides to write a diss track, "Takedown," the song's title comes from Mira's impassioned cry: "I'm taking these down! Just like how we're gonna take down these boys!"

However, as Rumi grows closer to the demon Jinu, her convictions as a hunter begin to waver. Mira notices this change—Rumi's hesitation to fight, her defense of Jinu, and her desire to alter the aggressive lyrics of "Takedown." One night, Mira confronts Rumi, asking if she is hiding something, but Rumi evades the question.

The tension culminates in a fight on a subway train the day before the Idol Awards. Mira presses Rumi to explain her doubts, leading to a heated argument where Rumi cruelly throws Mira's insecurities back at her. As demons attack the train, Mira gives her an ultimatum: **"If you're with us, prove it."** After the battle, she leaves Rumi with the parting words that they must face the crisis "together," emphasizing her unwavering belief in the group.

On the day of the awards, Mira opens up to her members, admitting that while she can be abrasive and quick-tempered, being with them makes her feel okay. However, during their performance, demons trick Mira and Zoey into leaving the stage, then expose Rumi's demonic markings to the world.

Upon seeing the truth, Mira's first reaction is one of self-deprecating sorrow: **"I knew it. I knew it was too good to be true."** When Rumi's desperate cries unleash demonic energy, a resigned Mira points her weapon at her friend, her face contorted in sadness.

Afterward, broken and lost, Mira is swayed by Gwi-ma's whispers targeting her deepest fears about being unworthy of family. She pushes Zoey away, declaring "There is no 'us' anymore," and is drawn into the crowd heading for the Saja Boys' concert.

Just as the Honmoon is about to break, Rumi's song of self-acceptance cuts through the despair. Mira is the first to respond, her voice joining Rumi's with the lyric, **"I should've let the jagged edges meet the light instead."** HUNTR/X reunites, and in the final battle, Mira defeats Abby by yelling, **"No more abs!"** as she slices through his torso.

In the end, Mira, Rumi, and Zoey finally enjoy a bathhouse together. The scene symbolizes their growth: Rumi is open, Zoey is assertive, and Mira has softened her tough exterior.
