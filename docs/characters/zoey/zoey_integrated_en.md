### **1. Overview**

> "Okay, like I know I ramble / But when shootin' my words I go Rambo."
> — Zoey's rap verse in "How It's Done"

Zoey is a deuteragonist of **_K-Pop Demon Hunters_**. She is the main rapper and lyricist of the world-renowned K-pop group HUNTR/X and serves as the group's **_maknae_** (youngest member). A Korean-American who grew up in Burbank, California, her bubbly and fun-loving personality makes her the mood-maker of the group. While she has an adorable image, she transforms into a charismatic powerhouse when she raps. In combat, she wields **Shin-kal**, a set of throwing knives inspired by the tools of Korean shamans.

### **2. Appearance**

Zoey has black hair styled in twin braided buns (often called "Pucca hair") with micro-bangs and fringe locks. She has a rounder face, light brown eyes, freckles, and a heart-shaped mouth. Though the shortest member, she has a slender build with long limbs. She wears sparkly makeup and has numerous ear piercings.

Her stage outfits often feature a streetwear aesthetic, like a teal halter top and parachute pants, accessorized with a yellow **_norigae_** (a traditional Korean charm) decorated with cute ornaments that reflect her personality.

### **3. Personality and Character**

Zoey is perky, bubbly, and energetic, openly showing affection for her friends and fans. However, unlike the observant Mira, she can be quite naive, failing to notice Rumi's increasingly strange behavior. She is easily distracted and prone to being tricked, as seen when she can't resist dancing to the Saja Boys' infectious song.

Beneath her bright exterior lies a deep-seated insecurity about her identity. Having grown up between Korean and American cultures, she often felt like an outsider in both, a conflict explored in her lyrics for the song "Golden." Before joining HUNTR/X, she believed her own thoughts and lyrics were "weird and useless." She harbors a fear of being "too much, yet not enough," an eagerness to please that becomes a vulnerability the demon king Gwi-Ma later exploits.

Though gentle-natured, she is fiercely protective of her creative work. She shows genuine anger for the first time when Rumi dismisses her lyrics, nearly tearing up her notebook. When Rumi's secret is revealed, she is deeply hurt and confused, and her hesitation to draw all her weapons shows her reluctance to harm her friend.

### **4. Abilities and Combat Style**

#### **4.1 As an Idol**

- **Rapping Skills:** As the main rapper, Zoey is known for her lightning-fast delivery, which contrasts with the slower, rhythmic style of her rival, Baby of the Saja Boys.
- **Lyricism:** She is implied to be the group's primary lyricist.
- **Sub-Vocalist:** She also provides high-pitched chorus and background vocals.

#### **4.2 As a Hunter**

- **Weaponry (Shin-kal):** Zoey wields a set of six throwing knives called _Shin-kal_. According to the art director, the animation team developed a fighting style for her that resembles professional knife or card throwing.
- **Combat Style:** Unlike Rumi (a duelist) and Mira (a crowd-control specialist), Zoey is a versatile fighter who mixes ranged attacks with close-quarters combat. When unable to resummon her knives, she seamlessly transitions to kicks and acrobatic martial arts.
- **Combat Demeanor:** She often maintains a playful, smiling expression in battle, treating demons like toys. This has earned her the fan nicknames **"Zoey-chopath"** and "clear-eyed maniac," as she can admire a handsome demon's face one moment and ruthlessly annihilate him the next, showing a stark separation between her personal feelings and her duty.

### **5. In-Story Arc**

Recruited by Celine from her home in Burbank, Zoey becomes a member of HUNTR/X. After an intense world tour, she is eager to relax, but her plans are cut short by Rumi's push for their new single, "Golden." She is supportive of Rumi's vocal struggles, suggesting a healer she found among 57 researched methods.

She is the first to naively suggest the Saja Boys might be "nice demons" and develops an immediate crush on their member, Mystery. Despite this, she joins the fight against them. As Rumi grows distant, Zoey becomes hurt and confused, especially when Rumi criticizes her lyrical contributions.

At the Idol Awards, Rumi's half-demon secret is revealed, leaving Zoey feeling betrayed and asking, "How are we supposed to be with you when we don't know what's a lie and what's the truth?" She reluctantly draws her weapons after Mira. Broken and vulnerable, she is brainwashed by Gwi-ma's whispers targeting her insecurities: "You're too much, but you're not enough. There's no place for you."

She is saved by Rumi's song of self-acceptance, responding with her own lyric: "Why did I cover up the colors stuck inside my head?" Reunited, HUNTR/X defeats their enemies. In the final battle, Zoey punches Mystery, exclaims "He's totally my type!" and then promptly destroys him. The story concludes with the three members healing their bonds and growing together.

### **6. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **Identity:** Her Korean-American background is central to her character, reflected in details like her hamburger-flavored ramyeon. A popular fan theory suggests her parents are divorced, based on the "Golden" music video visuals.
- **Love for Turtles:** She is an avid turtle lover, owning turtle-themed pajamas and charms. Fans theorize this is because she, feeling displaced, envies turtles for always carrying their homes with them.
- **Deleted Backstory:** A scrapped storyboard revealed a backstory where Zoey was a victim of school bullying.
- **Fan Connections:** She was a fan of the previous hunter group, the Sunlight Sisters, before her debut. In the fandom, her ship with Mystery is canonically named **"Zoeystery."**
- **"Gateway Character":** With her cute design, bright personality, and surprising depth, Zoey is often considered the "gateway character" who attracts new fans to the series.
- **Neurodivergent Fan Theory:** A popular fan theory posits that Zoey is neurodivergent (e.g., having autism or ADHD).
