## üìñ Story

Raised in Burbank, California, the heart of the American animation industry, Zoey always felt like an outsider. She filled notebooks with lyrics and song ideas, a passion others found strange. Her journey is one of navigating a dual identity, feeling caught between her Korean heritage and American upbringing. This internal conflict is visualized in the music video for "Golden," where she is torn between two hands, one representing Korea and the other, America.

Her life changed when she was recruited by **Celine** to join **HUNTR/X**. In the group, her "useless and weird" notebooks became the source of the band's powerful lyrics, and she finally found a place where she belonged. As the group's maknae, she is playful, optimistic, and often acts as the emotional glue, mediating conflicts and checking in on her friends' well-being.

Despite her cheerful demeanor, Zoey is a fierce and loyal fighter. When Rumi's half-demon nature is revealed, Zoey is initially frightened but quickly becomes her staunchest defender, helping her escape and later facilitating the reconciliation between Rumi and Mira. During the final battle, she proves her mettle, not only as a warrior but as the unwavering heart of the team.
