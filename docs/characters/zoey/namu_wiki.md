### **1. Overview**

> "Okay, like I know I ramble / But when shootin' my words I go Rambo / Took blood, sweat, and tears to look natural."
> — Zoey's rap verse in "How It's Done"

Zoey is the deuteragonist of _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. She is the main rapper of the world-renowned K-pop group HUNTR/X and the group's youngest member (_maknae_), known for her cute and energetic persona. While she has an adorable image, she transforms into a charismatic powerhouse when she raps. Her weapon of choice is the _Shin-kal_, a set of shamanic knives.

### **2. Character Details**

Zoey has a bubbly, energetic, and sometimes ditzy personality. She is generally cheerful and gentle, rarely getting angry. The first time she shows true anger is when Rumi dismisses her lyrical suggestions for "Takedown," leading Zoey to nearly rip up her cherished notebook in frustration.

#### **2.1 As an Idol**

As the group's main rapper, Zoey is also implied to be the primary lyricist for HUNTR/X. Her rap style is characterized by fast-paced delivery, which contrasts with the slower, more rhythmic flow of Baby, the rapper for the rival group Saja Boys. This difference often puts them at odds, and Zoey clearly dislikes Baby, likely due to their rivalrous positions. She also contributes high-pitched chorus vocals in songs like "How It's Done."

#### **2.2 As a Hunter**

Zoey wields six _Shin-kal_ (three in each hand). While Rumi specializes in one-on-one duels and Mira excels at crowd control, Zoey's fighting style is a versatile mix of ranged and close-quarters combat. She throws her knives with deadly accuracy and, if unable to resummon them, seamlessly transitions to powerful kicks and even flying armbars. This is why her movements most heavily incorporate the motion capture work of Taekwondo national athlete Tae-mi.

She often maintains a cheerful, almost playful demeanor even in battle, treating demons like toys. This has earned her the fan nickname "Zoey-chopath" and a reputation for being ruthlessly professional. She might apply makeup to a demon before casually dispatching it or admire a handsome demon's face moments before destroying him.

### **3. In-Story Arc**

A Korean-American from Burbank, California, Zoey was recruited by Celine to join HUNTR/X. The film opens with the group fighting demons on their private jet before making a spectacular landing on stage, where Zoey blows a heart to the camera in a meta moment. After the show, her plans to relax and watch 700 two-second turtle shorts are thwarted by Rumi's sudden announcement of their next single, "Golden."

In the "Golden" music video, her lyrics explore her identity struggles: "I lived two lives, tried to play both sides / But I couldn't find my own place." When Rumi's voice fails, Zoey comforts her and suggests a visit to a traditional healer, one of 57 methods she researched (a self-homage by the creators, who wrote 57 versions of "How It's Done"). At the clinic, the healer diagnoses her with an "overly eager to please" nature. Later, she comically reacts to Saja Boys member Abby's abs with "popcorn eyes."

Initially, Zoey is the only one to suggest that the Saja Boys might be "nice demons," showcasing her naive optimism and a clear crush on the members, especially Mystery. This causes her to get distracted by their music and flustered in their presence. However, she joins her friends to fight them in a men's bathhouse, hilariously complaining that bathhouses are supposed to be relaxing.

As tensions rise between the groups, Zoey is seen admiring a picture of Mystery, much to Mira's annoyance. During a joint fansign, she is initially flustered sitting next to Mystery but is openly disgusted when placed next to her rival, Baby. The pressure mounts when Rumi, influenced by Jinu, hesitates to perform their aggressive diss track. Feeling her contributions are being dismissed, Zoey becomes deeply hurt. After a failed mission, she tells Rumi, "We can't win without your voice."

On the day of the Idol Awards, Zoey shares her heart with the group, confessing that before HUNTR/X, she felt her lyrics and notebooks were "useless and weird," but with them, she feels like she means something. Her hopes are shattered when Rumi's half-demon secret is exposed. Betrayed and confused, Zoey asks, "How are we supposed to be with you when we don't know what's a lie and what's the truth?" Following Mira's lead, she reluctantly draws two of her six knives, symbolizing her hesitation and the fracturing of their trio.

Lost and heartbroken, Zoey is manipulated by Gwi-ma's whispers: "You're too much, but you're not enough. There's no place for you... but I can give you one." She is then drawn to the Saja Boys' concert.

Just as the Honmoon is about to break, Rumi's song of self-acceptance reaches her. Zoey responds with her own lyric, "Why did I cover up the colors stuck inside my head?" Reunited, HUNTR/X enters the final battle. During the fight, Zoey punches Mystery, declares "He's totally my type!" with sparkling eyes, and then promptly annihilates him.

In the end, the three friends finally enjoy a bathhouse together, a scene symbolizing their growth and healing.
