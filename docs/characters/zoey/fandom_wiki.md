### **1. Overview**

Zoey is one of the two deuteragonists of the 2025 animated musical fantasy, _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. She is a gifted K-pop idol, serving as the lead rapper and lyricist for the globally successful girl group HUNTR/X. As the group's _maknae_ (막내, the youngest member), her perky and fun-loving personality shines through. Though ethnically Korean, she grew up in Burbank, California. Alongside her bandmates Rumi and Mira, Zoey leads a double life as a demon hunter, protecting humanity by wielding throwing knives called _shin-kal_.

### **2. Appearance**

Zoey has black hair styled in twin braided buns with micro-bangs and fringe locks that frame her face. She is distinguished by her rounder features, including light brown eyes, freckles, and a heart-shaped mouth. She wears sparkly makeup, golden bracelets, and a combination of gold rings and black leather on her fingers. Like her group members, she has a slender build with long limbs but is the shortest of the three. She has numerous ear piercings: six on both ears (lower lobe, upper lobe, tragus, middle helix) and a rook piercing on her left ear.

For HUNTR/X's first performance, Zoey wears a streetwear fashion outfit. Her teal halter top features black leather straps, yellow accents, and a pink lotus design. Her high-waisted parachute pants have geometric patterns, dual teal straps at the hips, and a yellow _norigae_ (노리개, a traditional good-luck charm) designed with cute accessories to reflect her personality. She completes the look with chunky yellow and black athletic sneakers.

### **3. Personality**

Zoey is perky, bubbly, and energetic, openly showing affection for her friends and fans. She can also be very naive, as seen when she believes tonics can magically fix a singer's voice or when she fails to pick up on Rumi's increasingly strange behavior, unlike the more observant Mira. Her lovable and easygoing nature makes her easy to get along with.

She is highly prone to distraction and easily entertained, tricked, and excited. This is demonstrated when she can't resist dancing to the Saja Boys' song "Soda Pop" on two separate occasions. Her optimism is also a key trait, as she initially wonders if the Saja Boys could be "nice demons." She quickly develops a crush on the Saja Boys member Mystery, getting nervous around him and keeping a picture of him on her wall.

Despite her bright energy, Zoey has deep-seated insecurities about her identity, stemming from her upbringing between two cultures. In the song "Golden," her lyrics reveal a feeling of not belonging to either America or Korea. She later confesses that before joining HUNTR/X, she felt her own thoughts and creative ideas were "weird" and useless. She also has a fear of being "too much, but not enough for others," which the healer Han describes as an "eagerness to please, maybe a little too eager." This insecurity is ultimately what allows the demon king Gwi-Ma to manipulate her mind in the film's third act.

When Rumi's demon marks are revealed, Zoey is shown at her most vulnerable. She is deeply hurt, questioning how she could ever trust Rumi again. Her hesitation to draw her weapons against Rumi—pulling her knives out only after Mira does—shows her reluctance to harm her friend.

### **4. Background and Plot**

Zoey was born in Korea but raised in Burbank, California. Before being recruited by Celine to become the rapper for HUNTR/X, she filled notebooks with songs and lyrics, which often received negative reactions from her peers. A popular fan theory suggests Zoey's parents may be divorced, with one living in America and the other in Korea. This is based on her lyrics in "Golden" where she sings about "trying to play both sides" while being visually pulled in two different directions. Alternatively, this can be interpreted as her internal conflict over her dual Korean-American identity.

### **5. Abilities, Skills, and Weaponry**

- **Rapping Skills:** As the main rapper of HUNTR/X, Zoey is exceptionally talented, capable of rapping at lightning speed.
- **Demon-Hunting:** Chosen by Celine, she is an excellent demon hunter alongside her friends.
- **Spirit Magic:** Like her fellow hunters, Zoey can use spirit magic to conjure weapons and create energy barriers empowered by her soul and the souls of her fans.
- **Mediumship:** She can see spirits, demons, and the spiritual energy of the Honmoon, allowing her to detect its fluctuations and nearby threats.
- **Weaponry - Shin-kal:** Zoey's weapons are throwing knives called **shin-kal**, inspired by the traditional tools of Korean _mudang_ (shamans). The name translates to "god's knife." According to the film's art director, "It was challenging to research its original use, so our animation team came up with a brilliant idea: she improvised with it in a way similar to knife throwing, or card throwing." In the film, Zoey wields six of these knives, which she uses as thrown projectiles.
