As the **maknae** (youngest) of Huntrix, Zoey is **playful**, **goofy**, and **energetic**. Her expressiveness and talent for lyrical storytelling make her a key contributor to Huntrix’s songs.

She's also the **emotional glue** of the group, famously breaking down first in the bathhouse during their three-month hiatus after releasing _"This Is What It Sounds Like."_

Despite her light-hearted demeanor, Zoey is **fiercely protective** of her friends, often throwing herself into danger to protect Rumi, Mira, and even their fans.

She demonstrates unwavering loyalty, particularly when **Rumi is revealed to be a half-demon**. Though initially scared, she lets Rumi escape and later plays a vital role in helping **Mira and Rumi reconcile** during the final battle.

Zoey is often the one to check in with her friends emotionally, offering lyrics, jokes, and compassion after battles or during moments of stress.
