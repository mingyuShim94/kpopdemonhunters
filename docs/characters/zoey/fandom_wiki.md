## 1. Story

Zoey was born in Korea, but raised in Burbank, California, USA. Before she joined Huntrix, she made songs and lyrics in many of her notebooks, but however, people thought it was useless and weird. Despite the constant comments from her old school, she still persisted into becoming a rapper in Huntrix. Eventually, Celine recruited her as the rapper in Huntrix and is now known as the rapper and lyricist of the group.

## 2. Personality

As the **maknae** of the group, Zoey is seen as **playful, goofy and energetic**. Her expressiveness and profound understanding of lyrics helps her craft lyrics for Huntrix's songs. She's also the emotional glue of the group, as she was seen crying first in the bath-house in the middle of their three-month hiatus after the song _"This Is What It Sounds Like"_.

But despite her bubbly exterior, she's actually very **protective of Rumi and Mira**, and the fans. Zoey fights fiercely alongside them, often putting herself in danger to shield them from demonic attacks. Her spirit magic is frequently used defensively when her friends are vulnerable.

Even after fighting through chaos, she never lets Mira or Rumi carry their burdens alone. Even after Rumi was revealed to be a half-demon, Zoey never truly gives up on Rumi. Though she initially points her blades at Rumi in fear, she lets her escape. She believes in their bond and fights to restore it, helping Mira reconcile with Rumi during the climax.

In flashbacks and quieter moments, Zoey is often the one checking in on Rumi after a fight, or on Mira's stress, offering lyrics or jokes and advice to lift their spirits.
