> "Our faults and fears must never be seen. That's the only way to protect the Honmoon."

Celine is a former hunter and a member of the 1st-generation K-pop girl group, the Sunlight Sisters. She is the mentor to the current generation of hunters, HUNTR/X, and has a perfectionist tendency, prioritizing the hunters' mission above all else and believing that any weakness must be hidden. She lives on Jeju Island, where she guards a _seonangdang_ (shrine). Based on the end-credits illustration, her weapon as a hunter was likely a pair of dual swords.

After the death of her bandmate, Ryu Mi-yeong, Celine became the adoptive mother and mentor to her daughter, Rumi. Her love for Rumi is absolute. She was the only one who knew Rumi's half-demon secret and maintained the belief that the "Golden Honmoon" would solve everything, urging Rumi to hide the truth until then.

While she poured her heart and soul into raising Rumi and the other HUNTR/X members into top-tier idols and hunters, her perfectionist ideology—"you must hide your flaws"—became a major source of conflict. Unlike the conflict between the HUNTR/X members, which was resolved, the rift between Celine and Rumi remains unhealed at the end of the film, positioning Celine as a potentially crucial character in a possible sequel.

Their final confrontation was deeply painful for both. When Rumi, in her despair, questioned if Celine ever truly loved her, it was akin to a child asking a parent if they were resented for being adopted. This exchange deepened the chasm between them. The reason for Celine's almost obsessive compulsion to hide Rumi's markings is a key plot point likely to be explored in the future.

#### **Real-Life Inspirations and Fan Theories**

- **Lee Hyori Motif Theory:** Her status as a "former idol living on Jeju Island" has led many to believe she is based on the legendary K-pop star Lee Hyori. However, Celine's perfectionist and secretive nature is the complete antithesis of Lee Hyori's famously candid and open personality.
- **S.E.S. Bada Motif Theory:** A more likely inspiration is Bada from the 1st-generation girl group S.E.S. Celine's group, the Sunlight Sisters (SLS), debuted in 1997, the same year as S.E.S. Both Celine and Bada were the leaders of their respective groups, share a physical resemblance, and have a cautious, community-focused personality.
- **Lea Salonga's Cameo:** The legendary Lea Salonga is credited as Celine's singing voice, but she only sings a single line of the hunter's mantra in a flashback. It was confirmed that she was hired specifically for this one line.
- **Scrapped Dark Backstory:** Concept art revealed a shocking, scrapped storyline where Celine was responsible for Ryu Mi-yeong's death, an "accident" related to Mi-yeong's demon husband. While not used in the final film, the creators intentionally left the details vague, leaving the possibility of using it in a sequel.
- **Divided Fan Reception:** Reception to Celine is often divided by age. In Korea, many adult viewers sympathize with her difficult position. However, sing-along screenings have shown that children often boo her, seeing her as an oppressive parental figure. LGBTQ+ communities have also been critical, interpreting Rumi's story as an allegory for coming out and viewing Celine as a conservative parent who refuses to accept their child's true identity.
