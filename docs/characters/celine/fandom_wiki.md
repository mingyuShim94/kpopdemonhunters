### **1. Overview**

Celine is one of the overarching protagonists of _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. She is a retired member of the Sunlight Sisters, a first-generation K-Pop group that also operated as a team of demon hunters. Celine serves as the maternal figure to the film's main protagonist, Rumi, having adopted her following the death of her mother and fellow bandmate, Mi-yeong Ryu.

### **2. Appearance**

Celine is a tall, middle-aged woman with a fair complexion and sharp facial features. She has long, flowing black hair with a few gray streaks, brown almond-shaped eyes, and full pink lips. In the present day, she is seen wearing a simple white tank top with a gray jacket and pants.

### **3. Personality**

Celine is a kind-hearted person who wants the best for her adoptive daughter, Rumi. She is an elegant and relatable mentor to the members of HUNTR/X, offering sharp but fair criticism. However, she is also deeply ingrained in the traditional ideology of the Hunters, which holds that all demons are evil and any personal flaws must be hidden to protect the Honmoon.

This prejudice made her unable to fully accept Rumi's half-demon nature. Fearing that Rumi would be persecuted for her heritage, Celine taught her to suppress and hide her demonic side, believing it was the only way to protect her and possibly "purify" her. While her intentions were good, this unintentionally caused Rumi to develop a deep-seated self-rejection. Her stubbornness ultimately made her less understanding of Rumi's situation than even Rumi's friends, Mira and Zoey.

### **4. Plot**

**Backstory:** In the 1990s, Celine was a member of the popular K-pop group and demon-hunting team, the Sunlight Sisters, alongside Rumi's mother, Mi-yeong. After Mi-yeong died, Celine took custody of her infant daughter, Rumi. Soon after, the Sunlight Sisters disbanded, and Celine retired from public life to raise Rumi.

Discovering that Rumi had inherited demonic markings, Celine instructed her to conceal them, teaching her that completing the "Golden Honmoon" would make them disappear. Years later, she formed the next generation of hunters, HUNTR/X, with Rumi, Mira, and Zoey as its members.

**Main Events:** When the Honmoon is shattered, Rumi, in her semi-demonic form, finds Celine on Jeju Island. Consumed by despair, Rumi begs Celine to end her life. Celine refuses, confessing that she vowed to protect Rumi as the last remnant of her mother, even if it meant raising a child who defied everything she was taught.

However, Celine clings to denial, insisting they can still hide the truth by claiming Rumi's markings were an illusion. Rumi rejects this, declaring she would rather see the Honmoon destroyed than live a life of shame. She teleports away, leaving Celine devastated. Although Rumi eventually finds self-acceptance and creates a new, stronger Honmoon, Celine's fallout with her due to her prejudice is left unresolved.

### **5. Abilities and Skills**

- **Weapon Proficiency:** As a former hunter, Celine presumably had her own weapon and was skilled in combat.
- **Mediumship:** Even in retirement, she is still able to see the Honmoon.
- **Singing & Dancing:** As a first-generation K-Pop idol, she presumably possesses a powerful singing voice and is an efficient dancer.

### **6. Trivia**

- Celine is the only known living member of the Sunlight Sisters.
- Arden Cho, Rumi's voice actress, originally auditioned for the role of Celine.
- In the ending credits, renowned singer **Lea Salonga** is credited as Celine’s singing voice, though she only sings a single line of the hunter’s mantra in a flashback.
- In an early version of the story, Celine was responsible for Mi-yeong's death. This idea was scrapped but, had it been included, would have painted her prejudice in a much darker light.
- It is believed that Celine lives on Jeju Island, as indicated by the presence of _dol hareubang_ (stone statues) in her final scenes.
