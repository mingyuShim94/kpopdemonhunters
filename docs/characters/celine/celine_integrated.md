## üìñ Story

Celine was once a member of the iconic 90s K-pop group **Sunlight Sisters**, alongside Rumi's mother, **Miyeong Ryu**. During their time, they fought demons while performing, and historical footage shows Celine managing to create an incomplete version of the **Golden Honmoon**, a testament to her power. After Miyeong's death, Celine adopted her daughter, Rumi, raising her as both a hunter and an idol. She gave Rumi her name, likely derived from Miyeong's, and instilled in her the rigid principles of a hunter.

Celine's core belief is that the Golden Honmoon‚Äîa perfect spiritual barrier‚Äîis the ultimate goal, and that achieving it requires flawless execution and the suppression of all personal weaknesses. This conviction leads her to hide the truth of Rumi's half-demon heritage from her, fearing it would compromise their mission and endanger the world. She promised Rumi that completing the Golden Honmoon would erase her demonic patterns, a promise born from her vow to her deceased friend, Miyeong.

This well-intentioned secrecy, however, becomes a major source of conflict. When Rumi suggests confiding in her bandmates, Celine forbids it, insisting that personal feelings are a liability. Her perfectionism inadvertently sows discord within HUNTR/X and creates a deep rift between her and Rumi. The emotional climax of their relationship occurs when Rumi, feeling betrayed, questions if Celine ever truly loved her. The accusation deeply wounds Celine, who had grappled with the internal conflict of loving a child who was also part-demon‚Äîa being she was sworn to hunt.

While the members of HUNTR/X eventually reconcile, the conflict between Rumi and Celine remains unresolved, hinting at a significant storyline for a potential sequel. Concept art even explored a darker path where Celine was responsible for Miyeong's death, though this was not included in the final film.

## ‚ú® Trivia

*   Fans have speculated that Celine is based on K-pop icon **Lee Hyori**, who also lives on Jeju Island. However, their personalities are opposites; Celine preaches perfection, while Lee Hyori champions self-acceptance. The filmmakers have stated that her character is more closely inspired by **Bada** from the group **S.E.S.**, whose group name (SLS for Sunlight Sisters) and personality align more closely with Celine's.
*   The **Sunlight Sisters** debuted in **1997**, and Celine's style from that era (wavy hair, large hoop earrings) is reflective of the time.
*   Although legendary Broadway actress **Lea Salonga** is credited as Celine's singing voice, she only sings a brief lullaby with a young Rumi in the film. This suggests that a full song for Celine may have been cut during production.
*   Album art from 1997 shows Miyeong in the center, but performance footage shows Celine in the center, suggesting she may have become the leader of Sunlight Sisters later on.
