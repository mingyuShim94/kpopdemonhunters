Of course. Here is the final, comprehensive English profile for the character Sussie, combining all the details from both source documents.

### **Sussie**

#### **1. Overview**

Sussie is a mascot character from _K-Pop Demon Hunters_ and one of Jinu's former pets, always seen alongside her companion, Derpy. She is a supernatural magpie with six eyes. Her official name, Sussie, was confirmed by the director and is a pun based on her constantly "suspicious eye" (Sussie) expression.

#### **2. Appearance**

Sussie resembles a real-life magpie with a slender build and black-and-white plumage, but with a few key supernatural features: she has three eyes arranged vertically on each side of her face (for a total of six) and sharp teeth in her beak. Her most distinctive feature is the small, black Korean _gat_ (hat) she wears, which she reportedly stole from Derpy. This unique six-eyed design is an original concept for the film, with no clear precedent in East Asian mythology.

#### **3. Personality and In-Story Arc**

In sharp contrast to the dim-witted Derpy, Sussie is intelligent, sassy, and competent. She often gives her exasperated companion exasperated looks, annoyed by his clumsy antics. She also has kleptomaniacal tendencies, as evidenced by her stolen hat.

Despite her mischievous and sarcastic nature, she is fiercely loyal to both Derpy and their owner, Jinu. Like Derpy, she is a **"good spirit or yokai"** and is not a demon, allowing her to remain in the human world after the Honmoon is restored. After Jinu's demise, she and Derpy are adopted by Rumi and now live peacefully with the members of HUNTR/X.

#### **4. Trivia and Background**

- **Motif:** She is based on the magpie from the Korean folk art style known as **_Kkachi Horangi_** (Magpie and Tiger). Her act of stealing Derpy's hat can be interpreted as a satirical nod to the folk painting's original meaning, where the commoner magpie often outwits the foolish aristocratic tiger.
- **"Galaxy Magpie":** Her vertically arranged, three-eyed appearance on each side of her head led fans to nickname her the "Galaxy Magpie," due to the resemblance to the camera lenses on Samsung Galaxy smartphones. This became so popular that Samsung officially collaborated with the film for a Galaxy Unpacked 2025 promotional video featuring Sussie.
- **Name Pronunciation:** Her name can be pronounced as "Sussie" or "Soo-ji," with the creators confirming that both are correct.
