### **1. Overview**

Rumi is the main protagonist of _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. She is the leader and main vocalist of the world-renowned K-pop group HUNTR/X. She is the daughter of Ryu Mi-yeong, a member of the previous generation of hunters known as the Sunlight Sisters. After her mother's death, Rumi was taken in and raised by her mother's colleague, Celine.

### **2. Abilities**

Rumi wields a _Saingeom_ (a spirit-slaying sword) as her weapon. Like the other members of HUNTR/X, she possesses physical abilities far beyond that of a normal human. She is capable of parkour-level feats, leaping between buildings with complete silence, demonstrating mastery in stealth. She can hold her own in a direct power struggle with Jinu and can even skydive from a plane without a parachute, landing on stage completely unharmed.

Her combat sense is exceptionally sharp. During her first battle with Jinu, she was able to predict his teleportation attacks and counter them. This skill was so formidable that when Jinu later sought to speak with her alone, he had to lure her with a mannequin, implying a direct ambush would have resulted in his own serious injury. Even when they met at Naksan Park, Jinu was startled by her sudden appearance, unable to sense her approach. This explains why Jinu, a high-ranking demon, chose an indirect "idol showdown" strategy rather than a direct confrontation with HUNTR/X.

Later in the story, her _Saingeom_ is enhanced, transforming into a massive _Chilseongkal_ (Seven Star Sword) engraved with the image of a _dokkaebi_ (Korean goblin/demon).

As the leader and main vocalist of HUNTR/X, Rumi is often depicted as more powerful than her two bandmates. The hunters' exorcism method involves igniting the spirits of people through music and using the resulting bond to create a protective barrier called the _Honmoon_. As the main vocalist, Rumi's power is portrayed as the strongest in this process.

#### **2.1. Idol Abilities**

As an idol, Rumi is a monster-class talent. While officially the main vocalist, she is a "hexagonal center" who perfectly covers all areas, including dance, rap, and visuals. In the animation, she performs live vocals for songs that even professional singers would find difficult to sing while standing still, all while executing intense choreography.

It is inferred that she underwent rigorous training from a young age under Celine, who was a top idol of her time. Furthermore, despite it being a children's animation, her actions in the film suggest she also serves as a producer for HUNTR/X.

### **3. In-Story Arc**

**Warning: Spoilers ahead.**

Born to Ryu Mi-yeong, a member of the hunter group Sunlight Sisters, Rumi lost her mother at a young age and was raised by her mother's colleague, Celine. Following in her mother's footsteps, she becomes both an idol and a hunter, leading HUNTR/X as its main vocalist. On the night of their World Tour final show, Rumi and her members discover their private jet has been hijacked by demons disguised as flight crew. They perform their song "How It's Done" while effortlessly defeating the demons, making a spectacular parachute-free landing on their concert stage. During the performance, a corner of the _Honmoon_ barrier begins to glow gold, signaling that its final, perfect form is near.

Excited by this, Rumi unilaterally announces their next single, "Golden," a song she believes will complete the Golden Honmoon, without consulting her members. While Mira and Zoey are dismayed at their vacation being cut short, they celebrate when their manager, Bobby, informs them of the song's overwhelmingly positive public reception.

However, behind the scenes, Rumi harbors a secret. As revealed when she changes into her stage outfit, her arms are covered in demonic markings. Rumi is a cambion, born to a human mother and a demon father, and these markings are the proof. On Celine's advice, she has hidden them her entire life. While the markings were small enough in her youth to be covered by short sleeves, they have now spread to cover most of her upper body. This is why she has repeatedly declined invitations from Mira and Zoey to go to a public bathhouse. She pushed for the "Golden" single so urgently because Celine taught her that completing the Golden Honmoon would sever her demonic lineage and make the markings disappear.

Contradicting the song's lyrics, "No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be," Rumi covers her markings and strengthens her resolve. However, during rehearsal, her voice fails on a high note. She discovers the markings have spread to her neck. Terrified of losing her career, she runs to the rooftop in despair, crying out about the impossibility of fixing the world and herself when her voice is gone. During this outburst, her demonic power flares, causing a red energy to spread across the _Honmoon_.

The live performance is canceled, but her members comfort her. The group visits a traditional healer to fix her voice. The healer notes that Rumi has built so many walls around herself that he cannot see her true nature, an allusion to the secret she hides even from her friends. Afterward, they encounter the rival group Saja Boys and realize they are demons. In the ensuing confrontation in a men's bathhouse, Rumi's sleeve is torn, revealing her markings to the Saja Boys' leader, Jinu. In a surprising turn, Jinu pulls her into an embrace and uses a towel to cover the markings before her own members can see.

As the Saja Boys' popularity weakens the _Honmoon_, Rumi suggests creating a diss track to defeat them at the upcoming Idol Awards. That night, she receives a letter from Jinu, written in traditional vertical script, asking to meet. She goes, intending to defeat him, but instead learns of his tragic past. This encounter, along with his act of covering her secret, causes her to question the black-and-white morality of mercilessly killing all demons. This creates a rift between her and her bandmates, particularly Mira.

In subsequent meetings, Rumi proposes a deal to Jinu: if he lets HUNTR/X win, the completed Golden Honmoon will sever the connection to the demon world, freeing him while also curing her. When Jinu questions if the _Honmoon_ can protect her, Rumi confesses, "You made a mistake trying to protect your family, but my very existence is a mistake." Jinu replies, "I don't think you're a mistake." This emotional vulnerability allows her voice to gradually return. On the eve of the awards show, she and Jinu sing "Free" together, resolving to confront their secrets and overcome them. Jinu promises that the Saja Boys will not aim for victory.

On the day of the Idol Awards, the members of HUNTR/X share their true feelings and resolve their conflicts, though Rumi still cannot bring herself to reveal her secret. They decide to perform "Golden" instead of their diss track, "Takedown." With her emotional wounds healed, Rumi flawlessly delivers her solo part. However, Mira and Zoey are lured away from the stage by demons in a ploy involving a fake kidnapping of their manager. At the song's climax, the stage lights go out. When they return, the music has switched to "Takedown," and demons disguised as Mira and Zoey are on stage. They use the lyrics meant for Saja Boys to attack Rumi, forcibly tearing off her jacket and exposing her demonic markings to the world.

Fleeing backstage, Rumi tries to explain to her shocked members that the markings will disappear once the _Honmoon_ is complete. But every time she raises her voice, demonic energy radiates from her, causing her friends to aim their weapons at her in fear. Betrayed by her friends and Jinu, a furious Rumi confronts him. Jinu coldly states that everything was a lie to gain her trust. Crushed by everyone she trusted, Rumi mentally breaks down and begins to transform, her body becoming more demonic as she gains the ability to teleport.

She goes to Celine and begs her to kill her before she destroys the _Honmoon_ herself. Celine, who loves her like a daughter, refuses but hesitates to touch her in her semi-demonic state. Celine insists they can still hide the truth and complete the Golden Honmoon. In response, Rumi declares she is done hiding. She proclaims, **"If this is the Honmoon I'm supposed to protect, I'm glad to see it destroyed,"** and teleports away, leaving Celine in despair.

Meanwhile, HUNTR/X is disqualified from the awards. The Saja Boys hold a special concert at Namsan Tower, where their music, amplified by the crowd's despair, begins to shatter the _Honmoon_. Just as it's about to break, Rumi appears. When the demon king Gwi-ma mocks her, she calmly replies, **"Then, we'll just make a new one."** She begins to sing, and having accepted her true self, her powers return stronger than ever. Her demonic markings transform from a sinister dark purple to a radiant rainbow color. Hearing her song, Mira and Zoey break free from Gwi-ma's influence. Reunited, HUNTR/X engages in a final battle. Jinu, moved by Rumi's courage, sacrifices himself to save her from Gwi-ma's attack, giving his soul to her. His soul, now pure blue like a human's, merges with her sword, transforming it into a giant, _dokkaebi_-engraved _Chilseongkal_.

With this newfound power and the support of their fans, HUNTR/X defeats Gwi-ma. Three months later, a healed Rumi enjoys a day at the bathhouse with Mira and Zoey, finally able to be open about who she is. This scene shows the growth of all three members: Rumi is no longer hiding, Zoey is learning to speak her mind directly, and Mira has tempered her harshness. Though they plan a vacation, they immediately abandon it to hold a street fan meeting for young fans. In the end, her markings remain, but they are now accepted by her friends and even featured on their comeback banner.

### **4. Miscellaneous**

- The backstory of how Rumi's parents met and fell in love is never revealed, leaving a significant mystery, especially since hunters view demons as pure evil.
- Rumi is the only character with demonic blood who is immune to Gwi-ma's voice, a fact Gwi-ma himself notes. Fans have theorized that her mother may have embedded an incomplete Golden Honmoon within Rumi at the cost of her own life, which would also explain why Rumi's own soul is never visually depicted in the final battle.
- Her family's ancestral home and her mother's tomb appear to be on Jeju Island, based on the traditional _sandam_ grave style and the presence of _dol hareubang_ statues in flashbacks.
- Sequel hooks remain, as Gwi-ma was likely only temporarily banished, not destroyed. The _Honmoon_ was restored as a rainbow-blue barrier, not the prophesied pure golden one, and Rumi's markings, which Gwi-ma called "my markings," did not disappear.
- The spread of her markings is directly linked to her emotional state and stress levels.
- Voice actress Arden Cho stated she wanted Rumi to be as cool as real-life K-pop groups like BLACKPINK, aespa, and LE SSERAFIM.
- In fan works, Rumi is most often paired with Jinu (a ship named "Rujinu" by fans in-universe) or with Mira, with whom she had significant conflict.
- Rumi's singing vocalist, EJAE, is a Korean composer and singer who has worked on songs for groups like aespa ("Armageddon") and Red Velvet ("Psycho").
- A two-second scene early in the film where Rumi exaggeratedly sniffs kimbap became a viral meme. The meme was even acknowledged in-universe, with a fan shown using fanart of the scene as their profile picture. The simple but expressive gag has led to numerous fanart parodies with other characters.
- The cartoonishly exaggerated way she eats the kimbap whole was, according to director Maggie Kang, an intentional choice to create funny and relatable female characters.
- As the main vocalist, Rumi sings the most challenging parts of their songs. "Golden" features sustained notes in the 3rd octave, hitting a solid A5 repeatedly. "How It's Done" also hits an A5 and includes a whistle note at D6. This has led to fan jokes that her voice problems were not due to a curse, but simply from vocal nodules.
- Her signature braided hairstyle, which is even longer than Mira's already very long hair, is inherited from her mother, Ryu Mi-yeong. The design is likely inspired by the traditional Korean _gache_ wig.
- Rumi's initial design was created in 2016 by director Maggie Kang's husband, artist Rad Sechrist, for a personal project called "Plastic Walrus." Kang loved the design so much she adapted it for the film.
- Rumi's name was given to director Maggie Kang's real-life daughter, not the other way around. The project was in development for nine years, long enough for her daughter to grow old enough to voice the younger version of the character.
- According to a concept artist, her surname is confirmed to be Kang, making her full Korean name "Kang Rumi."
