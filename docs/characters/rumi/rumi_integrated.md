## üìñ Story

Rumi's mother, a renowned demon hunter, passed away when Rumi was young, leaving her in the care of her mother's colleague, Celine. From a young age, Rumi was taught to hide the demonic patterns on her skin, a mark of her half-demon nature. Celine promised that if Rumi could conjure the "Golden Honmoon"‚Äîa powerful barrier against demons‚Äîher patterns would vanish.

Driven by this goal, Rumi forms **HUNTR/X** with her friends Mira and Zoey. After a successful world tour, which culminates in a dramatic battle against demons aboard a hijacked plane, Rumi grows desperate. Her demonic patterns are spreading, and she fears losing control. In a unilateral decision, she releases the single **"Golden,"** believing it will create the Golden Honmoon, which causes friction with her bandmates.

Her desperation leads to a crisis of confidence, and her voice fails her during a live show. The group's focus shifts to the upcoming International Idol Awards, where they believe the Golden Honmoon can finally be formed. During this time, they encounter a rival boy band, the **Saja Boys**, who are secretly demons. Rumi develops a complex connection with their leader, **Jinu**, who discovers her secret but helps conceal it. He reveals that demons are controlled by shame, a feeling Rumi knows all too well.

At the awards show, Jinu betrays Rumi, using illusions and her own unreleased song lyrics to expose her demonic patterns to the world. Shunned by her friends and the public, Rumi hits rock bottom. After a heated confrontation with Celine, she rejects the oppressive ideal of the Golden Honmoon. In a powerful act of self-acceptance, she interrupts the Saja Boys' concert, declaring she will create a *new* Honmoon, one that doesn't require her to hide.

In the final battle, her song reignites the souls of her friends and fans. Jinu, moved by her resolve, sacrifices himself to save her from the Demon King, Gwi-Ma. His soul merges with her sword, empowering her to defeat the villains and restore peace. In the end, Rumi embraces her full identity, confidently displaying her patterns, which now glow with a faint rainbow hue‚Äîa symbol of her integrated self.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Powers and Abilities

*   **Superhuman Physicality**: Like all hunters, Rumi possesses enhanced agility, strength, and stealth, allowing her to perform feats like parkour between buildings and surviving great falls.
*   **Master Vocalist**: As HUNTR/X's main vocalist, her singing is her primary weapon. Her voice can generate powerful spiritual energy, inspire hope in allies, and create the Honmoon. Her vocal range is immense, hitting a 3-octave A5 in chest voice and a 4-octave D in whistle register.
*   **Weaponry - Sain-geom (ÏÇ¨Ïù∏Í≤Ä)**: Rumi wields a magical sword she can conjure at will. After Jinu's sacrifice, the sword is enhanced, and its engravings change from a constellation to the sigil of Chiwoo Cheonwang (a Korean god of war), symbolizing her acceptance of both her hunter and demon heritage.
*   **Spirit Magic**: Rumi can see and interact with spirits and demons. She uses the collective soul energy of her fans to power her attacks and create the Honmoon.
*   **Demon Magic**: As a hybrid, Rumi has access to demonic powers, though her control is initially limited by her self-hatred.
    *   **Teleportation**: She can teleport in a cloud of magenta smoke.
    *   **Demonic Screech**: An enraged scream that can send shockwaves through the Honmoon.
    *   **Demonic Patterns**: Marks of shame for most demons, Rumi's patterns glow magenta when she's distressed but shift to a silver-blue or rainbow color once she accepts her identity.
