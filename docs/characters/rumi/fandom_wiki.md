## Story

For a long time, demons have attacked humans and stolen their souls to feed the Demon King **Gwi-Ma**. Three women rose as demon hunters, defeating the demons by using their singing voices to create a barrier called the **Honmoon** to seal them out of the human world. This legacy was passed down through generations who used their singing voices to maintain the Honmoon.

Rumi's mother, **Miyeong**, was a member of the **Sunshine Sisters** — a now-disbanded K-Pop group and the previous generation of demon hunters. She had conceived Rumi with a demon and died shortly after Rumi was born. **Celine**, another member of the Starlight Sisters and Miyeong's friend, made a promise to preserve all that's left of her, which meant raising Rumi. From a young age, Rumi was taught to hide her demonic heritage, with Celine stating that when Rumi grows up to be a demon hunter and conjures the **Golden Honmoon**, her demonic **markings (patterns)** will disappear.

Later, the K-pop girl and demon hunter group **HUNTR/X** was formed under the mentorship of Celine, with its members being Rumi, Mira, and Zoey. After defeating demons and finishing their world tour, Rumi rushes to release their newest single **"Golden"** in hopes of creating the Golden Honmoon faster as her demonic patterns have been growing and spreading around her body. However, she **loses her voice at a live performance** due to her patterns, and **abandons the stage**. Huntrix regroups and focuses their energy on preparing for their performance at the **International Idol Awards** instead, which is when the Honmoon is strengthened for the year and when the group believes the Golden Honmoon will be formed.

Huntrix then encounters a new boy band, the **Saja Boys**. Though nearly deceived, they sense something is off. They confirm that the Saja Boys are demons but fail to stop them in a scuffle; **Jinu** discovers Rumi's heritage and keeps it from Mira and Zoey.

He meets with Rumi privately, revealing that demons are **controlled by shame and misery through voices Gwi-Ma whispers to them**. Jinu recounts how, 400 years ago, Gwi-Ma gave him a beautiful voice that helped lift his impoverished family. Jinu became a palace performer but was eventually banished to the demon realm and is haunted by guilt over his family losing everything. Jinu's demonic patterns are a mark of his shame over this incident, while Rumi's mark her shame over her heritage.

Huntrix later performs their single **"Golden"** at the International Idol Awards, hoping to create the Golden Honmoon. Beforehand, Rumi makes a deal with Jinu — the Saja Boys would **forfeit their performance** so that Huntrix would get a guaranteed win. Rumi nearly succeeds at creating the Golden Honmoon during her solo, but is **betrayed by Jinu** who creates **demon illusions** of Zoey and Mira to attack Rumi on stage, while using the lyrics of HUNTR/X's **unreleased song "Takedown"** against her.

After the incident on stage, **Rumi's patterns are revealed** to Zoey and Mira who **turn against her out of fear**. Rumi confronts Jinu, who reveals his backstory was partially fabricated and that he was the one who abandoned his family. Later, Rumi finds Celine and asks for her life to be ended, and when Celine refuses and tells her to cover up her patterns, Rumi retorts that the demonic patterns are **a part of who she is**, and that she's glad the Honmoon is destroyed.

Rumi teleports to the Saja Boys' performance and interrupts it, and states to the Demon King that **the world knows what she is and that she will create a new Honmoon**. Rumi reignites Mira and Zoey's souls with her song, and they together work to defeat the Demon King, the Saja Boys, and swarms of other demons. During this, Rumi is attacked by a blast of energy from the Demon King, but **Jinu steps in to sacrifice himself** and give Rumi his soul. Rumi is dismayed at Jinu because she wanted to save him but Jinu tells her that she already had saved him before **disintegrating into ashes** in front of her.

With the power of Jinu and the **fans' souls**, HUNTR/X defeats the Saja Boys and the Demon King, as well as **restores the Honmoon**. At the end of the movie, Rumi is seen being more confident and open about her patterns, wearing more revealing clothes in front of others including young fans and even going to the **bathhouse with Mira and Zoey**.

## Trivia

- Maggie Kang's daughter, **Rumi Oak**, is named for the character and voices Rumi as a child.
- Rumi was originally a character for a different project, but the film's director, Maggie Kang, loved the design so much she made her the main character of _KPop Demon Hunters_.
- Not much is known about Rumi's parents. Many viewers speculate that her mother might have met her father in the same way Rumi met Jinu and fell in love.
- Rumi's demonic patterns are a mark of her shame over her demonic heritage, meaning that when she worries or panics over her patterns, her patterns ironically grow more.

- Rumi's full name was stated to be "**Rumi Nim**" in an official Netflix merch drop, from when Healer Han refers to her in the movie.

  - "Nim" is, however, **not a real Korean surname** and is instead an **honorific** used to show respect, similar to "Mr(s)" or "Miss" in English.
  - The **T-shirt referencing her full name** has now been **removed from the store** after backlash.
