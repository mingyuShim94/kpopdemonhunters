### **1. Overview**

Romance Saja is a member of the Saja Boys and serves as a minor antagonist in the film _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is a demon who takes on the guise of a K-Pop idol to lure fans away from the demon-hunting girl group HUNTR/X as part of a plan to weaken the protective Honmoon barrier. He is voiced by Joel Kim Booster, with samUIL Lee providing his singing voice.

### **2. Appearance**

Romance is a skinny man of average height with a long, slightly angular face, a narrow nose, and full lips. In his human disguise, he has pale skin, voluminous pink hair styled to resemble a heart, and hazel eyes. He paints his nails sky blue. In his demon form, he has purple skin with glowing patterns, clawed hands, sharp teeth, and golden eyes with slit pupils.

As an idol, Romance wears stylish clothing, including collared shirts with puffy sleeves, skinny jeans, and various accessories like necklaces and wallet chains. In his true demon form, he wears a tattered black _hanbok_ and a _gat_. During the "Your Idol" performance, he blends these styles, wearing a sheer mesh top under a traditional overcoat.

### **3. Personality**

Romance is portrayed as the most "romantic" member of the Saja Boys, leaning heavily into a charming and flirtatious persona on stage. He frequently strikes passionate poses and uses his powers to conjure floating hearts as fanservice for the audience. He makes a conscious effort to maintain this image even under pressure, such as attempting to hold a pose during a spicy food challenge despite visibly struggling.

However, beneath this charming facade, Romance is an immoral demon who willingly serves Gwi-Ma. Off-stage, he is more aloof, easily irritated, and finds his idol duties tiring. He has a habit of invading others' personal space, particularly Mira's, by maintaining prolonged eye contact and staying in close physical proximity. Like the other Saja Boys, he also displays aggression when their plans go awry.

### **4. Plot**

**Backstory:** Little is known about Romance's early life. It is assumed that he was once human and was transformed into a demon after making a deal with the demon king, Gwi-Ma.

**Main Events:** Romance first appears in the Demon Realm when Jinu proposes the plan to form a K-pop boy band. As a member of the Saja Boys, he makes his debut in the human world and quickly gains popularity. He competes on a variety show, flees from HUNTR/X, and reports the group's success to Gwi-Ma, looking visibly exhausted by the idol work.

During a joint fan signing event, Romance is seated next to Mira and immediately begins to flirt with her. He playfully bickers with her and Abby over who should sign a fan's cast, a moment that leads to the three of them being shipped as a "throuple" by fans. Throughout the event, he never takes his eyes off Mira. Despite appearing touched by fan gifts, he discards them in the trash immediately after.

In his final appearance, Romance performs "Your Idol" in his demon form. When HUNTR/X reunites, he attacks the girls and engages in a brief fight with Mira. After Jinu's sacrifice, he launches another attack but is countered by Mira, who jabs him with her weapon. His ultimate fate is not explicitly shown, leaving his status unknown.

### **5. Abilities and Skills**

- **Demonic Powers:** As a demon, Romance can steal souls, teleport, levitate, and shapeshift between his human and demon forms.
- **Immortality:** He is effectively immortal, unless killed by a demon hunter or Gwi-Ma.
- **Conjuration:** He can create floating hearts out of thin air as a form of fanservice.
- **Artistic Talents:** As a K-pop idol, he is an exceptional dancer and a proficient singer.

### **6. Quotes**

- "I waited so long for a taste of soda, so the wait is over, baby." — Romance singing "Soda Pop."
- "We have to give a shout-out to HUNTR/X, we couldn't have done it without their support." — Romance, sarcastically "thanking" their rivals.
- "Your obsession feeds our connection, 이 순간 (at this moment) give me all your attention." — Romance singing "Your Idol."

### **7. Trivia**

- Romance's character design took the longest to finalize.
- Unlike the other Saja Boys, Romance does not have a specified role (like main dancer or rapper) and is simply referred to as a vocalist and dancer.
- In-universe, Romance is shipped with Mira and Abby, with the canon ship name being **Miromabby**. This is the only polyamorous ship in the film.
- Romance could be interpreted as a symbol of the fanservice that is rampant in the K-Pop industry.
