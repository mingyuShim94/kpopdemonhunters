### **1. Overview**

> "Hmm, we keep meeting like this."
> — Romance, attempting to flirt with Mira

Romance Saja is a supporting antagonist in **_K-Pop Demon Hunters_**. He is a member of the demon idol group, Saja Boys, and is presumed to be the group's **lead vocalist**. While his official position is unconfirmed, fans have given him this title based on his significant vocal contributions to their songs, where he handles the second-most lines after Jinu, as well as high notes, harmonies, and choruses.

He is a demon disguised as a K-pop idol, tasked with luring fans away from the hunter group HUNTR/X to help weaken the protective Honmoon barrier.

### **2. Appearance and Personality**

Romance is a handsome young man with an androgynous appearance. His most defining feature is his voluminous, pink, heart-shaped, 50/50 parted hairstyle. In his human form, he has pale skin and hazel eyes, and he meticulously styles himself, down to his sky-blue painted nails. In his true demon form, his skin turns purple, and his eyes glow gold.

On stage, he fully commits to his "romantic" concept, frequently striking passionate poses and conjuring floating hearts as fanservice. He is openly flirtatious, as seen when he immediately tries to charm Mira at a fan signing event. However, this persona is a facade. Off-stage, he is aloof, easily irritated, and finds the demands of being an idol exhausting. He has a habit of invading others' personal space, particularly Mira's, staring at her intently throughout their joint event, revealing a more sinister, demonic nature beneath the charm.

### **3. In-Story Arc & Significance**

**Backstory:** While little is known about his past, it is assumed that Romance was once human and became a demon through a pact with Gwi-ma.

**Present:** Among the Saja Boys (excluding Jinu), Romance has one of the smallest narrative roles. Unlike his bandmates who have clear character hooks, he lacks a distinct story purpose. He is involved in the fan-created "Miromabby" love triangle ship with Mira and Abby, but his actual interaction with Mira is minimal. Despite this, he appears to be genuinely intrigued by her.

On stage, however, Romance has a significant presence. He has the longest verse in "Soda Pop" and delivers a memorable performance in "Your Idol" with his iconic "gat-brim sweep" dance move. He also shows the most dramatic visual transformation between the two songs, shifting from a soft persona to a sharp, dark one.

In the final battle, he attacks HUNTR/X and is countered by Mira. His ultimate fate is not explicitly shown and is left ambiguous.

### **4. Abilities and Skills**

- **Demonic Powers:** He possesses standard demon abilities, including soul stealing, teleportation, levitation, and shapeshifting.
- **Immortality:** He is effectively immortal unless killed by a hunter or Gwi-ma.
- **Heart Conjuration:** As a form of fanservice, he can conjure floating hearts out of thin air.
- **Idol Talents:** He is an exceptional dancer and a highly proficient singer.

### **5. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **Occult Motif:** Fans speculate his demonic motif is the **_mongdal gwisin_** (bachelor ghost), the spirit of a man who died unmarried.
- **Design History:** His character design took the longest to finalize. His look is said to be inspired by **Yeonjun of TOMORROW X TOGETHER** and **Felix of Stray Kids**, and also bears a resemblance to the hairstyle of **Moon Hee-jun of the 1st-generation K-pop group H.O.T.**
- **Group Dynamics:** Official fanart suggests the age hierarchy is Jinu > Romance > Abby. The art director also jokingly mentioned that he is bad at learning choreography. Because he is often seen looking after the younger members, Mystery and Baby, fans have given him a "motherly" image.
- **Symbolism:** His character can be interpreted as a symbol of the **fanservice** culture prevalent in the K-pop industry.
- **Korean Meme:** In Korea, he became a popular meme for his resemblance to the streamer **Karami**.
- **Japanese Dub:** In the Japanese dub, he uses the personal pronoun "boku."
