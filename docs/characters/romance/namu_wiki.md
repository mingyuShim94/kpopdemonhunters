### **1. Overview**

> "Hm. We keep meeting like this."

Romance is a character in _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is a member of the demon idol group, Saja Boys, and is presumed to be the group's lead vocalist. His official position has not been confirmed, but fans speculate he is the lead vocalist due to his significant vocal parts in their songs, where he often handles the highest notes, harmonies, and choruses, second only to Jinu.

### **2. Character Details**

Romance is a handsome young man with an androgynous appearance, best known for his distinctive pink, heart-shaped, 50/50 parted hairstyle.

Among the Saja Boys members, who have limited screen time outside of Jinu, Romance has one of the smallest roles. Unlike Abby (the "abs guy"), Baby (the rap rival), and Mystery (Zoey's love interest), Romance lacks a clear narrative hook. While he is part of the "Miromabby" love triangle ship with Mira and Abby, his actual interaction with Mira is limited to a brief conversation at a fansign. Despite this, he seems genuinely interested in her, as he is shown staring at her throughout the entire event.

On stage, however, his presence is significant. In "Soda Pop," he has the longest verse and performs high-note ad-libs with Mystery. In "Your Idol," he sings the chorus and has a memorable dance sequence where he sweeps his hand across the brim of his _gat_, which became a fan-favorite moment. His on-stage image also shows the most dramatic transformation; he shifts from a soft and mellow persona in "Soda Pop" to a sharp and dark presence in "Your Idol."

His visual style appears to be more popular with international fans than with Korean audiences, where his "greasy" look and longish hair have been met with some resistance.

Like his bandmate Baby, Romance's final fate is not explicitly shown on screen; he is simply omitted from the final battle after being countered by Mira.

### **3. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **Occult Motif:** Fans speculate his demonic motif is the _mongdal gwisin_ (bachelor ghost), a spirit of a man who died unmarried. Another theory connects him to _Jigwi_, a Korean fire spirit associated with unrequited love, linking him to the fire-based demon king, Gwi-ma.

- **Group Hierarchy & Personality:** An official fanart by the art director suggests Romance is older than Abby but younger than Jinu. The art director also jokingly stated that Romance is actually bad at learning choreography. While his singing voice is a beautiful falsetto, his speaking voice is a deep baritone.

- **Fan Reception & Image:** While other members have clear archetypes (leader, muscle, etc.), Romance is often seen as the member without a distinct trait, aside from his impactful hairstyle. However, he is a core vocal member of the group. Fans have developed a "motherly" image for him, as he is often seen with the younger members, Mystery and Baby, resting their arms on his shoulders.

- **Design Reference:** His design is said to be inspired by Yeonjun of TOMORROW X TOGETHER, particularly during his pink hair era. Some international fans also see a resemblance to Felix of Stray Kids. His hairstyle is also very similar to that of Moon Hee-jun from the 1st-generation K-pop group H.O.T.

- **Korean Meme:** In Korea, he became a hot topic for his resemblance to the streamer Karami, who has since reacted to the character and even performed his dance moves.

- **Japanese Dub:** In the Japanese dub, he uses the personal pronoun "boku."
