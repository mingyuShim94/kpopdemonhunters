## 📖 Story

Like the other members of the Saja Boys (excluding Jinu), Romance’s backstory is largely unknown. He serves the Demon King, Gwi-Ma, as a loyal minion. His primary role in the film is to be a charismatic performer, helping to steal souls through the Saja Boys' music.

Despite his limited role in the plot, he has a significant presence on stage. In the song **"Soda Pop,"** he has the most lines, and his smooth vocals are a highlight. In **"Your Idol,"** he takes center stage during the chorus, and his sharp, dark performance shows a stark contrast to his usually gentle image, revealing a larger character gap than any other member.

He has very few interactions with the members of **HUNTR/X**. While fans have created a polyamorous ship called **"Miromabby"** (Mira + Romance + Abby), his only canonical interaction with Mira is a brief conversation during a fan signing event. He and Baby are the only two members of the Saja Boys whose death/disintegration is not explicitly shown on screen.

## ✨ Trivia

*   His occult motif is believed to be a **Chonggakgwisin** (총각귀신), the restless spirit of a bachelor who died before he could marry. Another theory suggests he could be a **Jigwi** (지귀), a fire demon, which would connect to the fiery nature of the Demon King, Gwi-Ma.
*   His 5:5 parted, heart-shaped pink hair is his most defining feature.
*   His English voice actor, **Joel Kim Booster**, also voices the MC at the variety show and the Idol Awards.
*   In Korea, he became a hot topic for his resemblance to the streamer **Karami** (카라미). Karami even made a reaction video to it and later appeared in a dance video with the popular YouTuber **Nitmocash** (닛몰캐쉬), where he danced to the Saja Boys' song.
*   His visuals are said to be more popular with international fans than with the domestic Korean audience.
