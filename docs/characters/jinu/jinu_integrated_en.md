### **1. Overview**

> "It's time for a new strategy."

Jinu is the male protagonist and main villain of **_K-Pop Demon Hunters_**. He is the leader of the demon idol group, Saja Boys, and serves as the right-hand man to the demon king, Gwi-ma.

However, unlike other demons, Jinu does not follow Gwi-ma blindly and is the only demon who retains a significant degree of his humanity. He harbors a deep resentment for Gwi-ma, who orchestrated the circumstances that forced him to abandon his family. He cooperates with the demon king purely out of a transactional necessity: to have his painful memories erased. He serves as the leader, center, and main vocalist for the Saja Boys.

### **2. Appearance**

Jinu is a tall, slender man who appears to be in his early twenties. In his human form, he has pale skin, black hair styled with curtain bangs, and brown eyes. In his true demon form, his skin turns purple with glowing patterns, and he has claws, sharp teeth, and golden eyes with slit pupils.

As an idol, he wears stylish, modern clothing. In private, he opts for a more casual look. As a demon, he wears a tattered black _hanbok_ and a _gat_ (traditional hat). In his past life during the Joseon Dynasty, he first wore ragged clothes, which were later replaced with a clean, baby blue _hanbok_ after he became a palace performer.

### **3. Personality**

Jinu is intelligent and charismatic, but also duplicitous and primarily driven by self-interest. His entire plan to destroy the Honmoon is a means to an end: erasing the memories that cause him immense guilt and shame over abandoning his family. While he despises Gwi-ma, he believes this is the only way to free himself from his torment.

Initially, he appears to enjoy teasing and outsmarting HUNTR/X. However, subtle signs of his humanity persist: he helps Rumi after discovering her demonic markings, treats a fan's gift with care, and shows kindness to his animal companions. Despite his polished idol image, he can also be awkward and clumsy.

His interactions with Rumi reveal his more manipulative side, as he carefully edits his past to gain her sympathy. Yet, a genuine bond forms between them, rooted in their shared shame. This connection is what ultimately leads him to defy Gwi-ma and sacrifice himself for her.

### **4. In-Story Arc**

#### **4.1. Past**

Approximately 400 years ago in the Joseon Dynasty, Jinu lived in extreme poverty. Desperate, he accepted a deal from the demon king Gwi-ma for a powerful singing voice. His talent earned him a place in the royal palace, but he was faced with a choice: a life of luxury for himself alone, or a life of poverty with his family. He chose the former, abandoning them. Gwi-ma later transformed him into a demon, and the guilt of his decision haunted him for the next four centuries.

#### **4.2. Present**

Jinu proposes a new strategy to Gwi-ma: infiltrate the human world as K-pop idols to destroy the Honmoon barrier. In return, he asks for his memories to be erased. As the Saja Boys, they achieve immense popularity, weakening the barrier. During a battle, Jinu discovers Rumi's demonic markings and, feeling a sense of kinship, helps her hide them.

They begin meeting in secret, and a deep bond forms as they share their vulnerabilities. Jinu feels a glimmer of freedom from Gwi-ma's influence and sincerely promises to help Rumi. However, Gwi-ma discovers their alliance and tortures Jinu with memories of his past, forcing him to betray her.

At the Idol Awards, Jinu executes the plan, exposing Rumi's secret to the world and cruelly telling her she is unworthy of redemption. When she confronts him, he tearfully confesses the full truth of his choice to abandon his family.

During the final battle, as Rumi reappears with newfound strength, Jinu is moved. When Gwi-ma launches a fatal attack at her, Jinu intercepts the blow, sacrificing himself. In his final moments, he atones for his betrayal by giving his soul to Rumi, empowering her to defeat Gwi-ma. He then fades away, finally free from his guilt.

### **5. Abilities and Combat Prowess**

Jinu is the demon faction's second-in-command and chief strategist. His combat abilities are formidable, making him an equal or superior to Rumi. He is a master of teleportation, shapeshifting, and illusion magic. His most powerful weapon, however, is not his physical strength but his cunning intellect, which allows him to manipulate events and people. His singing and dancing can also be used to control human emotions.
