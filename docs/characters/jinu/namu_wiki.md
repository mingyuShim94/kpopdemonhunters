### **1. Overview**

> "It's time for a new strategy."

Jinu is the male protagonist and main villain of _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is the leader of the Saja Boys and the right-hand man of the demon king, Gwi-ma.

However, unlike other demons, he does not blindly follow Gwi-ma. As the only demon who retains a significant degree of his humanity, he harbors a deep resentment for Gwi-ma, who orchestrated the circumstances that forced him to abandon his family. He cooperates with the demon king purely out of a transactional necessity, telling Rumi, "If hate alone could have destroyed Gwi-ma, I would have done it first." He serves as the leader, center, and main vocalist for the Saja Boys.

### **2. In-Story Arc**

**(Warning: Spoilers Ahead)**

#### **2.1. Past**

> Jinu, tempted by Gwi-ma.

Approximately 400 years ago, during the late Gwanghaegun to early Injo period of the Joseon Dynasty, Jinu was born into poverty. He struggled to support his mother and younger sister by playing a ragged _bipa_ (lute) on the streets. It was during this time of despair that Gwi-ma appeared, tempting him with the promise of a powerful singing voice that could save his family. After accepting the deal, Jinu's talent blossomed, and he was granted residence in the royal palace.

However, his story to Rumi that his family joined him was a lie. In reality, Jinu was forced to choose between a life of luxury for himself or remaining in poverty with his family. He chose the former, abandoning them. Gwi-ma later dragged him to the demon realm and transformed him into a demon. For the next 400 years, Jinu was enslaved by a contract with Gwi-ma, who periodically offered to erase the painful memories of his family in exchange for his servitude. This cycle of guilt is what paradoxically allowed Jinu to retain his humanity; had he chosen to erase the memories, he would have become a mindless puppet like the other demons.

#### **2.2. Present**

> Jinu singing a lament about Gwi-ma's decline.

Jinu proposes a new strategy to Gwi-ma: to form a five-member demon boy band to counter HUNTR/X and destroy the Honmoon barrier. In return, he demands the complete erasure of his memories. This reveals that he has been living under the weight of his guilt for over 400 years. This guilt is a key part of his humanity. Unlike the other Saja Boys, who carelessly discard fan gifts, Jinu is shown thoughtfully looking at a fan's letter and gently placing a bouquet down.

As the Saja Boys, they achieve massive success with their debut song "Soda Pop," significantly weakening the Honmoon. Jinu's first encounter with Rumi is a brief, tense collision. Later, during a battle in a bathhouse, he discovers her demonic markings. In a pivotal moment, he chooses to help her hide them from her friends, feeling a sense of kinship with her.

Intrigued, he arranges a meeting. Initially, his goal is to exploit her weakness, but as they share their secrets, they become confidants who understand each other's shame. Jinu feels a genuine connection to Rumi, as she is free from Gwi-ma's mental control despite her markings. Their bond culminates in a duet of the song "Free," where Jinu, for a moment, feels liberated from Gwi-ma's influence and sincerely promises to let HUNTR/X win the upcoming Idol Awards.

However, Gwi-ma foils this by forcibly summoning Jinu back to the demon realm and tormenting him with vivid memories of his past, reminding him that he can never escape. Jinu is forced to betray Rumi.

At the Idol Awards, he carries out Gwi-ma's plan, exposing Rumi's secret and shattering her world. When she confronts him, he confesses the full, painful truth of his past: he willingly abandoned his family. This confession is filled with tears, revealing the immense guilt he has carried for centuries.

With HUNTR/X disbanded, Jinu and the Saja Boys hold a concert at Namsan Tower to finally destroy the Honmoon. Just as their plan is about to succeed, Rumi reappears, having accepted her full identity. Her powerful song begins to restore the barrier, and Jinu, moved by her strength, hesitates. As Gwi-ma launches a fatal attack at Rumi, Jinu makes his final choice.

> "I'm sorry... For... Everything...."
> "You did. You gave me my soul back. And now... I give it to you."

Jinu shields Rumi with his own body, atoning for his betrayal. In his final moments, his eyes revert to their human brown, and he gives his soul—now pure blue like a human's—to Rumi, enhancing her sword. This ultimate sacrifice allows HUNTR/X to defeat Gwi-ma. After his death, his loyal animal companions, Derpy and Sussie, are adopted by Rumi.

### **3. Combat Abilities**

Jinu is the demon faction's chief strategist and second-in-command after Gwi-ma. He devised the entire K-pop idol infiltration plan, demonstrating his intelligence.

His combat prowess is formidable, far surpassing other demons. In his first fight with Rumi, he lands the first blow and remains composed even when she counters, remarking, "Not bad." He is at least her equal in strength, if not superior. Even in his human form, he easily evades her attacks using teleportation and agility. If he had transformed into his true demon form, it's likely he could have killed her, but his affection for her held him back.

His true strength, however, lies in his magical abilities. His singing and dancing can manipulate human emotions, and he possesses shapeshifting and illusion-casting powers. Ultimately, his greatest asset was his cunning mind, which made him Gwi-ma's most valuable, albeit most rebellious, subordinate.
