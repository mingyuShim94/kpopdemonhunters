# Jinu

> **“I LEFT THEM! That's right, I lied to you. I only made a deal with Gwi-Ma to get myself out of that miserable life! I left my sister, my mother alone, while I slept in silk sheets in the palace with my belly full every night! I left them! I left them...”**
> – Jinu to Rumi, furiously and grievingly revealing he lied to her about his past

> **“Listen to yourself. Is it working? You are a demon, just like me. All we get to do is live with our pain. Our misery. That's all we deserve.”**
> – A pained Jinu to Rumi after sabotaging her at the Idol Awards under Gwi-Ma’s command

## Personality

Jinu is deeply two-faced. While kind and charming to Rumi and the Saja Boys at times, he remains a demon—ruthless, manipulative, and willing to steal the souls of his fans. He hides his dark nature well, masking it with charisma and cleverness.

Beneath his sly demeanor lies overwhelming guilt for abandoning his family. He resents his servitude under Gwi-Ma but sees it as a means to escape his painful memories. His inner conflict, shame, and longing for redemption shape many of his actions.

## History

### Background

400 years ago, Jinu lived in extreme poverty with his mother and younger sister. They belonged to the lowest class and survived through hardship, with Jinu playing a worn **bipa** (Korean lute) on street corners for coins.

One day, the demon king **Gwi-Ma** approached Jinu with promises of wealth and a better life. Desperate, Jinu accepted. His voice earned him a place in a grand palace, with fine food and silken beds—yet when he tried to bring his family, they were barred.

Jinu realized too late: the deal lifted **only him** from poverty. His family was left behind, their suffering deepened. Guilt gnawed at him. Demonic patterns spread across his skin as his shame grew, until he fully transformed into a demon bound to Gwi-Ma’s will.

Though centuries passed, Jinu remained tormented by what he had done. He later joined forces with other cursed beings like him—forming the **Saja Boys**.
