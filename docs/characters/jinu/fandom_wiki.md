### **Jinu**

> "That's right, I lied to you. I only made a deal with Gwi-Ma to get myself out of that miserable life. I left my sister, my mother, alone while I slept on silk sheets in the palace with my belly full every night! I left them! I left them..."
> — Jinu's confession to Rumi.

### **1. Overview**

Jinu is the secondary antagonist in the film _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He was the leader of the Saja Boys, a group of demons who masqueraded as a K-pop boy band.

Once human, Jinu was cursed to become a demon through a pact with the demon king, Gwi-Ma. Desperate to escape poverty, he accepted Gwi-Ma's offer of a powerful singing voice, but the deal forced him into a situation where he felt he had to abandon his family. Centuries later, he agreed to help Gwi-Ma destroy the protective Honmoon barrier in exchange for having his painful memories erased. To achieve this, he led the Saja Boys in a campaign to steal the fanbase of the demon-hunting idol group HUNTR/X, thereby weakening the Honmoon.

### **2. Appearance**

Jinu is a tall, slender man who appears to be in his early twenties. He has a long face with sleek features, including high cheekbones and a pointed chin. In his human form, he has pale skin, thick black hair styled with curtain bangs, and brown eyes. In his demon form, he has purple skin with glowing patterns, clawed hands, sharp teeth, and golden eyes with slit pupils.

As an idol, Jinu wears modern, stylish clothing like open-collared shirts, ripped skinny jeans, and high-top sneakers. In private, he opts for a more casual look, such as a hoodie and jacket. In his true demon form, he wears traditional Korean clothing, including a tattered black _hanbok_ and a _gat_ (a traditional hat). During the "Your Idol" performance, he blends these styles, pairing a _gat_ and a traditional overcoat with tight black pants and combat boots.

In his past life during the Joseon Dynasty, he first wore ragged clothes, with his hair in a topknot. After becoming a palace performer, he wore a clean, baby blue _hanbok_ with a proper _manggeon_ (headband).

### **3. Personality**

Jinu is intelligent, charismatic, and duplicitous, primarily driven by self-interest. He devises the plan to destroy the Honmoon and agrees to help Gwi-Ma solely to have his own painful memories erased. Internally, he is tormented by a deep sense of shame for abandoning his family to secure a life of luxury for himself. Though he serves Gwi-Ma, he secretly resents the demon king's cruelty and control, only following orders when it aligns with his goal of escaping his guilt.

Initially, Jinu enjoys teasing and outsmarting HUNTR/X, stealing their items, ambushing them with water demons, and laughing at his own deceptions. However, subtle signs of his humanity remain. He spares Rumi after discovering her similar demonic markings, treats a fan's gift with care, and shows kindness to his animal companions, Derpy and Sussie. He can also be awkward and clumsy, becoming flustered when an old woman mistakes Rumi for his girlfriend.

When interacting with Rumi, Jinu is more manipulative, carefully omitting details of his past to gain her sympathy. He projects his own experiences onto her, suggesting her friends might reject her for her demonic side. Despite this, his connection with Rumi becomes genuine. He develops a sympathetic bond with her over their shared shame, which ultimately leads him to stand up to Gwi-Ma and sacrifice himself to save her. It is unclear if he felt any genuine companionship with the other Saja Boys, as he is never shown interacting with them casually and shows no remorse for betraying their plan.

### **4. Plot**

**Backstory:** Approximately 400 years ago, during the Joseon Dynasty, Jinu lived in extreme poverty with his mother and sister. Desperate, he made a deal with Gwi-Ma for a powerful singing voice. This talent earned him a place in the royal palace, where he lived in luxury. However, he soon realized the pact only applied to him, and he was forced to leave his family behind. The guilt and shame from this abandonment eventually manifested as demonic markings that spread across his body until he fully transformed into a demon in service to Gwi-Ma.

**Main Events:** In the present day, Jinu proposes a new plan to Gwi-Ma: to destroy the Honmoon by infiltrating the human world as K-pop idols. In return, he asks for his human memories to be erased. His group, the Saja Boys, quickly gains popularity, weakening the Honmoon. During a confrontation with HUNTR/X, Jinu discovers Rumi's demonic markings and, feeling a sense of kinship, helps her hide them.

He arranges secret meetings with Rumi, sharing a manipulated version of his past to gain her trust. Their shared vulnerability and shame create a genuine bond between them, culminating in a duet performance of the song "Free." However, Gwi-Ma discovers their alliance and forces Jinu to betray Rumi by threatening him with visions of his family.

At the International Idol Awards, Jinu sabotages HUNTR/X's performance, exposing Rumi's secret and causing her friends to turn on her. He then cruelly tells a heartbroken Rumi that she is unworthy of redemption.

With HUNTR/X disbanded, Jinu and the Saja Boys prepare to shatter the Honmoon for good. However, a newly empowered Rumi returns and begins to restore the barrier with her music. In the final battle, as Gwi-Ma is about to kill Rumi, Jinu redeems himself by taking the fatal blow. With his last act, he transfers his soul to Rumi, enhancing her power and allowing HUNTR/X to defeat Gwi-Ma and forge a new Honmoon. After his death, his pets, Derpy and Sussie, are adopted by HUNTR/X.

### **6. Trivia**
