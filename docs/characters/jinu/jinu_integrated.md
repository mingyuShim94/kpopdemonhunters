## üìñ Story

Born into poverty during the tumultuous Joseon era, Jinu was a street musician, playing a worn bipa (lute) to support his mother and younger sister. Desperate to escape their miserable life, he made a deal with the Demon King, **Gwi-Ma**, who offered him fame and fortune in exchange for his soul. Jinu's newfound talent earned him a place in the royal palace, but the deal was a cruel trick: it lifted only him from poverty. When he tried to bring his family to the palace, they were barred from entry.

Consumed by guilt over abandoning them, Jinu was dragged to the demon realm and transformed. The demonic patterns that spread across his skin were a physical manifestation of his shame. For 400 years, he served Gwi-Ma, his memories of his family a constant source of torment. To escape this pain, he proposed a new deal: he would form a K-pop group, the **Saja Boys**, to destroy the demon-hunting **HUNTR/X** in exchange for having his memories erased.

As the leader of the Saja Boys, Jinu becomes a rival to HUNTR/X. He meets **Rumi**, the leader of HUNTR/X, and discovers her half-demon secret. Seeing a kindred spirit, he helps hide her identity, and the two develop a complex bond, sharing their pain and shame. For a moment, it seems Jinu might break free from Gwi-Ma's influence, even promising to forfeit a competition to help Rumi achieve her goal.

However, Gwi-Ma reasserts control, forcing Jinu to betray Rumi at the International Idol Awards, publicly exposing her demonic nature in a moment of profound cruelty. In the final confrontation, wracked with guilt, Jinu makes the ultimate sacrifice. He shields Rumi from Gwi-Ma's fatal attack, giving her his own soul to empower her. In his final moments, his demonic yellow eyes revert to their human brown, and his soul, a pure blue, merges with her sword. He dies not as a demon, but as a man who has finally atoned for his sins.
