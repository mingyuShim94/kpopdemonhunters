### **1. Overview**

Gwi-Ma is the main antagonist of _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is the all-powerful ruler of the Demon Realm and all demonkind. After being defeated by generations of Hunters, Gwi-Ma has been weakened and trapped beneath the Honmoon barrier. He is desperately searching for a new strategy to break the Honmoon, defeat the Hunters for good, and feast on human souls for all eternity to grow his power.

### **2. Appearance**

For most of the film, Gwi-Ma appears as a giant, disembodied mouth made of purple fire, lacking any other facial features or limbs. His pointed teeth form a menacing smile, and his mouth expands when he is angry or amused. In the film's climax, after consuming countless souls and the life force of his demon subjects, he grows even larger and develops nostrils and two glowing eyes with arched eyebrows.

### **3. Personality**

Gwi-Ma is depicted as manipulative, cruel, and ruthless. He cares very little for his minions, punishing their failures with absolute fury, as seen when he incinerates a demon for failing to kill the hunters. He finds pleasure in manipulating others by making deals for their deepest desires (such as power or wealth), only to cause them harm or force them to abandon their loved ones. He thrives on exploiting people's deepest insecurities and flaws, trapping them in their own shame, with the ultimate goal of having demons take over the world.

### **4. Plot**

**Backstory:** Centuries ago, Gwi-Ma commanded vast demonic armies, consuming human souls to increase his power. He was eventually challenged by the first generation of demon hunters, who created the Honmoon, a barrier that trapped him and his armies in the Demon Realm. Vowing to return, Gwi-Ma spent centuries sending minions through weak points in the barrier to attack each new generation of hunters, but these attempts always failed, causing him to grow weaker over time.

**Main Events:** After another failed attempt to kill the current generation of hunters, HUNTR/X, Gwi-Ma is approached by his servant, Jinu, with a new strategy: to form a K-pop boy band to win over human souls. Gwi-Ma initially scoffs at the idea but agrees to the plan in exchange for Jinu's continued servitude.

As the Saja Boys' career takes off, Gwi-Ma's power grows. When he senses Jinu developing feelings for the hunter Rumi, he manipulates Jinu by tormenting him with the guilt of abandoning his family, ensuring his loyalty. After Jinu successfully orchestrates the breakup of HUNTR/X, the weakened Honmoon allows Gwi-Ma's influence to spread, and he hypnotizes millions of people, drawing them to the Saja Boys' final concert.

Just as he is about to feast on their souls, he is interrupted by Rumi. He mocks her past failures, but she finds the strength to begin creating a new Honmoon with her song, "What It Sounds Like," which frees her friends from his control. Enraged, Gwi-Ma absorbs his own demon horde to power himself up and unleashes a torrent of fire at Rumi. However, the attack is blocked by Jinu, who sacrifices himself. Empowered by their fans' souls, the reunited HUNTR/X delivers a final blow, vanquishing Gwi-Ma and restoring the Honmoon.
