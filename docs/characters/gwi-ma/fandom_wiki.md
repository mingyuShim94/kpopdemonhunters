## Biography

Centuries ago, Gwi-Ma terrorized villages with his **demon army**, stealing and absorbing human souls to grow in power. He often **made deals with humans**, turning them into his demonic servants.

One such deal was with **Jinu**, a peasant in poverty who sought a better life. In exchange for fame and fortune, Jinu abandoned his family and became Gwi-Ma’s demon-bound servant.

Eventually, a generation of **demon hunters** used their **voices and music** to create a barrier known as the **Honmoon**, powered by fan energy, to trap Gwi-Ma and his demons beneath the Earth.

Over centuries, Gwi-Ma tried repeatedly to breach the Honmoon and eliminate successive generations of demon hunters — including the current group **HUNTR/X**, a K-Pop girl group.

When his tactics failed, **Jinu proposed the idea** of forming a K-Pop boy band called **Saja Boys** to collect human souls. Gwi-Ma was skeptical but agreed, erasing Jinu’s memories of betrayal.

As Saja Boys rose in fame, Gwi-Ma regained strength. When **Jinu developed feelings for Rumi** and began doubting the plan, Gwi-Ma **mentally tortured him**, forcing compliance.

As Rumi’s powers began disrupting the Honmoon, Gwi-Ma exerted mass control over the minds of Mira, Zoey, Bobby, and millions of fans gathering at **Namsan Tower**.

Gwi-Ma planned to feast on the souls during a Saja Boys concert, but **Rumi resisted**, singing “What it Sounds Like” to awaken Mira and Zoey. Enraged, Gwi-Ma absorbed his own minions to become more powerful.

In the final battle, empowered by the audience’s souls, **HUNTR/X defeated Gwi-Ma** and **restored the Honmoon**.
