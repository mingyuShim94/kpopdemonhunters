## üìñ Story

Centuries ago, Gwi-Ma reigned as the Demon King, terrorizing the world with his army and feeding on human souls to grow his power. He was eventually sealed away by a generation of demon hunters who created the **Honmoon**, a powerful barrier fueled by the collective energy of their fans. Weakened and trapped, Gwi-Ma spent centuries plotting his escape.

His opportunity came through a deal with **Jinu**, a desperate human who traded his soul for fame and fortune. At Jinu's suggestion, Gwi-Ma created the K-pop boy band **Saja Boys** to serve as his vessel, gathering soul energy from their unsuspecting fans. Gwi-Ma acted as their producer, showing a surprising level of flexibility and even enjoying their music as their popularity grew. He provided them with the power to create sophisticated illusions, allowing them to nearly defeat HUNTR/X.

As the Saja Boys' fame peaked, Gwi-Ma prepared to shatter the Honmoon during their massive concert at Namsan Tower. He even participated in the stage production, his fiery form creating spectacular pyrotechnics for the show. However, his plan was foiled when Jinu, having developed feelings for Rumi, betrayed him. Enraged, Gwi-Ma absorbed his own minions to achieve a monstrous final form.

In the final battle, he was confronted by the fully-awakened **HUNTR/X**. Empowered by Jinu's sacrifice and the unwavering support of their fans, the girls managed to defeat Gwi-Ma and restore the Honmoon, banishing him back to the underworld. While he was defeated, the fact that Rumi's demonic patterns remain suggests that his essence may not be entirely gone, leaving the door open for his return.
