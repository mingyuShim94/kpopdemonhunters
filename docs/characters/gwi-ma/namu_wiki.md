### **1. Overview**

Gwi-Ma is the true main villain, mastermind, and final boss of _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is the king of demons, the ruler of the Demon Realm, and the producer of the demon idol group, Saja Boys.

His motif is the Demon King Gwi-ma from the classic Korean novel _Samhanseupyu_. Once a terrifying entity who feasted on human souls, his power dwindled over the centuries due to the efforts of demon hunters who sealed him away. In his prime, he was a colossal being of fire, but by the film's present day, he is a mere shadow of his former self. Despite this weakened state, he remains an overwhelmingly powerful foe, only defeated by the combined power of an enhanced Rumi and the souls of thousands of fans.

### **2. Appearance and Personality**

> Gwi-Ma in his prime (top) vs. his weakened state (bottom).
> Gwi-Ma after regaining some power (top) vs. his final form (bottom).

Gwi-Ma appears as a giant, sentient flame of magenta-colored fire (_honbul_). He has a menacing, toothy mouth that expands when he is angry or amused. In the film's climax, after absorbing countless souls and the life force of his minions, he grows to a colossal size, developing nostrils and a pair of glowing eyes, and his voice deepens.

He is portrayed as a manipulative, cruel, sadistic, and power-hungry being. He despises his underlings, punishing any failure with merciless rage, as seen when he incinerates a demon for failing to kill HUNTR/X. His greatest pleasure comes from exploiting the deepest insecurities and traumas of both humans and demons, twisting their relationships and using their shame to control them.

### **3. In-Story Arc**

Trapped in the Demon Realm by the Honmoon barrier, Gwi-ma continuously sends his minions to the human world. When Jinu suggests a new strategy—fighting fire with fire by creating a rival idol group—Gwi-ma, despite his initial mockery, shows a surprising degree of flexibility and agrees to the plan. He acts as the producer for Saja Boys, providing them with the magical support needed to become top-tier idols, including flawless disguises and spectacular stage effects, all of which are tinged with his signature magenta color. In the final performance of "Your Idol," he even becomes a part of the stage production itself, his flames dancing to the rhythm of the song. This has led to the fan meme of him being a "small agency CEO who even handles stage direction."

In the final battle, just as his plan to absorb all the souls at the concert is about to succeed, he is thwarted by the sacrifice of Jinu and the power of the reunited HUNTR/X. Overwhelmed by their song, his fiery form is extinguished. His defeat is somewhat anticlimactic, as he has no final words and is simply overwhelmed. However, the ambiguous nature of his "demise"—whether he was truly destroyed or merely resealed—leaves the door open for his return in a potential sequel, a theory supported by the fact that Rumi's demonic markings did not disappear.

### **4. Combat Abilities**

As the ruler of the Demon Realm, Gwi-Ma is the most powerful being in the series' universe. He is overwhelmingly stronger than even Jinu, the second most powerful demon. He can telepathically whisper into the minds of demons and humans, monitoring their actions and forcibly summoning them at will. Even in his weakened state, the hunters could not face him in a direct confrontation.

His whispers can hypnotize mortals, a power he uses to lure thousands of people to the Saja Boys' concert once the Honmoon is broken. Even the hunters Mira and Zoey fell under his influence. His physical power is also immense; a single blast of his fire breath was enough to fatally wound Jinu. He rules over millions, if not billions, of demons, each of whom is a formidable threat on their own. The hunters' ultimate goal was not to destroy him—a feat considered nearly impossible—but to create the Golden Honmoon to permanently seal him away.

### **5. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **Occult Motif:** His fiery, formless nature and his love for music and dance are reminiscent of some depictions of the Korean _dokkaebi_ (goblin).
- **Initial Concept:** According to the director, Gwi-ma was originally conceived as a K-pop idol wannabe. In this early stage, he was intended to be voiced by **J.Y. Park**, the founder of JYP Entertainment. This initial idea is subtly referenced in the final film when Gwi-ma hums along to "Soda Pop."
- **Voice Actor:** The performance of his voice actor, **Lee Byung-hun** (the Frontman from _Squid Game_), has been a topic of debate. While his emotional expression is praised, some found his natural voice, even when modulated, not "demonic" enough, especially when compared to professional voice actors. However, his English performance was more widely praised for its deeper, more menacing tone.
- **Easter Egg:** At the Namsan Tower concert, a fan can be seen wearing a t-shirt with Gwi-ma's logo, suggesting the Saja Boys marketed him as a kind of mascot.
- **Korean Dub Details:** In the Korean dub, Gwi-ma's laughter is more pronounced and has a more "old man" feel.
- **Fan Theories:** It was a popular fan theory that Gwi-ma was Rumi's biological father, but this has been officially debunked by the director.
