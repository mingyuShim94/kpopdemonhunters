### **1. Overview**

Gwi-Ma is the true main villain, mastermind, and final boss of **_K-Pop Demon Hunters_**. He is the king of demons, the ruler of the Demon Realm, and the producer of the demon idol group, Saja Boys.

His motif is the Demon King Gwi-ma from the classic Korean novel _Samhanseupyu_. Once a terrifying entity who feasted on human souls, his power dwindled over the centuries after being sealed away by demon hunters. In his prime, he was a colossal being of fire, but by the film's present day, he is a mere shadow of his former self. Despite this weakened state, he remains an overwhelmingly powerful foe and the series' strongest character.

### **2. Appearance and Personality**

Gwi-Ma appears as a giant, sentient flame of magenta-colored fire, known in Korean folklore as a _honbul_ (soul-fire). He primarily consists of a menacing, toothy mouth that expands when he is angry or amused. In the film's climax, after absorbing countless souls, he grows to a colossal size, developing nostrils and a pair of glowing eyes, and his voice deepens.

He is portrayed as a manipulative, cruel, sadistic, and power-hungry being. He has no affection for his underlings, punishing any failure with merciless rage, as seen when he incinerates a demon for failing to kill HUNTR/X. His greatest pleasure comes from exploiting the deepest insecurities and traumas of both humans and demons, twisting their relationships and using their shame to control them.

### **3. In-Story Arc**

Trapped in the Demon Realm by the Honmoon barrier, Gwi-ma continuously sends minions to attack the human world. When his right-hand man, Jinu, suggests a new strategy—creating a rival K-pop idol group—Gwi-ma, despite his initial mockery, shows surprising flexibility and agrees. He acts as the producer for Saja Boys, providing them with the magical support needed to become top-tier idols, including flawless disguises and spectacular stage effects. This has led to the fan meme of him being a "small agency CEO who even handles stage direction."

As Jinu begins to waver due to his growing connection with Rumi, Gwi-ma torments him with his most painful memories to ensure his compliance. He successfully orchestrates HUNTR/X's breakup and weakens the Honmoon, allowing him to hypnotize thousands of people and draw them to the Saja Boys' final concert.

Just as he is about to absorb their souls, he is thwarted by the sacrifice of Jinu and the power of the reunited HUNTR/X. Overwhelmed by their song, his fiery form is extinguished. His defeat is somewhat anticlimactic, and its ambiguous nature—whether he was truly destroyed or merely resealed—leaves the door open for his return in a potential sequel. This theory is supported by the fact that Rumi's demonic markings did not disappear.

### **4. Combat Abilities**

As the ruler of the Demon Realm, Gwi-Ma is the most powerful being in the series' universe, overwhelmingly stronger than even Jinu.

- **Mental Domination (Telepathy & Hypnosis):** His most terrifying ability is to telepathically whisper into the minds of his victims, exploiting their trauma to control them. Once the Honmoon was weakened, his power was strong enough to hypnotize even the hunters Mira and Zoey. He can also monitor and forcibly summon any demon at will.
- **Soul Absorption:** He can consume the souls of both humans and demons to increase his own size and power.
- **Fire Breath:** In his enlarged form, he can unleash a torrent of demonic fire powerful enough to fatally wound Jinu with a single blast.
- **Immortality:** He is considered a nearly immortal being. The hunters' ultimate goal was never to destroy him—a feat seen as almost impossible—but to create the Golden Honmoon to permanently seal him away.

### **5. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **Name Origin:** His name comes from the Hanja characters **鬼** (_gwi_, "ghost/demon") and **魔** (_ma_, "evil spirit/magic"). An earlier name for the character was "Dueoksini."
- **Occult Motif:** His fiery, formless nature and appreciation for music are reminiscent of some depictions of the Korean _dokkaebi_ (goblin).
- **Initial Concept:** Originally, Gwi-ma was conceived as a K-pop idol wannabe, and the director considered casting **J.Y. Park**, founder of JYP Entertainment, for the role. This is subtly referenced when Gwi-ma hums along to "Soda Pop."
- **Initial Design:** Early designs were inspired by monstrous traditional Korean masks called _Gwimyeon_ and _Tal_.
- **Voice Actor:** **Lee Byung-hun** (The Frontman in _Squid Game_) is the only actor to voice his character in both English and Korean. Fan reception has been mixed, with some finding his voice not "demonic" enough, though his English performance was more widely praised for its deeper tone.
- **Easter Egg:** At the final concert, a fan can be seen wearing a T-shirt with Gwi-ma's logo, suggesting the Saja Boys marketed him as a mascot.
- **Fan Theory:** The popular fan theory that Gwi-ma was Rumi's biological father has been officially **debunked** by the director.
