### **1. Overview**

> "Okay, I can handle this. I'm not having a nervous breakdown."
> — Bobby trying to calm himself down.

Bobby is the tritagonist of **_K-Pop Demon Hunters_** and the dedicated manager of the girl group HUNTR/X. He is completely unaware of their secret identities as demon hunters, a truth the members likely conceal to protect him from becoming a target. In a refreshing departure from the incompetent or antagonistic manager trope often seen in idol media, Bobby is portrayed as exceptionally competent, loyal, and a pillar of stability for the group. He is seen as the "ideal manager."

### **2. Appearance**

Bobby is a short, pudgy man with a medium-light skin tone. He has wavy, dark brown hair combed back, a small mustache, and a faint patch of facial hair. His typical attire consists of a gray jacket and pants worn over a white HUNTR/X merchandise T-shirt, complete with a purple VIP lanyard and white high-top sneakers. He also has a matching stage outfit, signifying his status as an honorary fourth member of the group.

### **3. Personality and Role**

Bobby is a cheerful, dependable, and fiercely loyal manager. He handles the group's schedules, social media, and frequent crises with a calm, solution-oriented approach and a touch of dry humor. His dedication goes beyond professional duty; he genuinely loves HUNTR/X and cares for the members as if they were his own family. When a major on-stage incident occurs, his immediate reaction is to blame himself for not noticing their struggles sooner.

This deep emotional investment is also his greatest vulnerability. The demon king Gwi-ma exploits Bobby's fear of the group disbanding and being left alone, suggesting his work is his primary source of belonging. His passion for his job is so immense that he forgoes a much-needed vacation to oversee the surprise launch of a new single, a testament to his workaholic nature driven by pure affection for his artists.

His importance to the group is profound. The members trust him completely, comfortable with him visiting their apartment late at night. They care for him so much that they offer him their own luxury vacation and are easily lured into a trap when demons use a fake Bobby as bait, their urgency to save him overriding all suspicion.

### **4. Plot Summary**

Bobby is introduced in a state of panic, trying to manage a concert backstage while the group is still on a plane. Throughout the film, he navigates the chaos of their lives, from surprise single releases to Rumi's vocal issues and the sudden rivalry with the Saja Boys. Despite the stress, he remains a supportive presence.

After HUNTR/X's public breakup, a devastated Bobby is targeted by Gwi-ma's telepathic whispers. Preying on his feelings of failure and loneliness, Gwi-ma puts him in a trance, and he is seen numbly attending the Saja Boys' concert. However, he is among the first to be freed from the hypnosis by Rumi's song. As HUNTR/X reunites to defeat the demons, a proud and emotional Bobby watches them, declaring, "I love my girls."

### **5. Abilities and Skills**

- **Dancing:** He has some dance skills and is often seen happily dancing along to HUNTR/X's choreography during rehearsals.

### **6. Miscellaneous & Trivia**
