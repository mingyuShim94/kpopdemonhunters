Bobby is the manager of HUNTR/X. While he is unaware that the members are demon hunters—a truth they likely keep from him to protect him from becoming a primary target for demons—he is incredibly passionate about their careers and supports them wholeheartedly. His somewhat dated personality is hinted at by his ringtone: a remake of the classic Korean song "The Moony Night of Shilla."

He is portrayed as an exceptionally competent and dedicated manager. Even when the members suddenly disappear to fight demons, causing delays or even cancellations of live shows, he never scolds them. Instead, he takes charge of the cleanup, remarking, "Well, this is what I get paid for." He is shown to earn 3% of all HUNTR/X revenue, a massive sum given their global popularity, suggesting he holds a high-level position, akin to a chief manager. His dedication stems not just from professional responsibility but from a genuine love for the group and its members. When a major incident occurs at the Idol Awards, his first instinct is to blame himself for not noticing the members' struggles, rather than blaming them.

In the film's latter half, he is briefly brainwashed by Gwi-ma's whispers—which specifically target his fear of the group disbanding—and is seen holding a Saja Boys lightstick. However, once HUNTR/X reunites and defeats the demons, he snaps out of it and proudly supports them.

Unlike the often incompetent or antagonistic manager characters in other idol-themed animations, Bobby is refreshingly responsible and supportive, a trait that has surprised and delighted many viewers. He is seen as the "ideal manager." With his cuddly appearance and kind-hearted nature, he has gained a following among international fans as a "sweet guy." Korean fans appreciate him as an ideal modern professional: a successful workaholic driven by a pure passion for his job and a deep affection for his artists.

His importance to the group is evident. He wears a stage outfit that matches the members, and after their world tour, the girls offer him their own luxury resort vacation, acknowledging he deserves the rest. They are completely comfortable with him visiting their apartment late at night to discuss work, and they care for him so deeply that Mira and Zoey fall for a demonic trap that uses a fake Bobby as bait, their urgency to save him overriding any suspicion.
