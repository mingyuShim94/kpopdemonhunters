### **1. Overview**

Bobby is the tritagonist of _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is the dedicated manager of the girl group HUNTR/X, responsible for their schedules and public image. He is completely unaware of their secret identities as demon hunters. Bobby's voice is provided by Ken Jeong.

### **2. Appearance**

Bobby is a short, pudgy man with a medium-light skin tone and dark brown eyes. He has wavy, dark brown hair that is combed back, with two strands falling over his forehead. He has a small mustache and a faint patch of facial hair on his chin.

He is primarily seen wearing an open gray jacket and matching pants over a white T-shirt featuring HUNTR/X merchandise. He wears a purple VIP lanyard around his neck and white high-top sneakers.

### **3. Personality**

Bobby is the cheerful and loyal manager of HUNTR/X, coming across as slightly bumbling yet consistently dependable. He takes his job seriously, overseeing everything from schedules to social media. Though unaware of the supernatural side of the girls' lives, he serves as a constant source of stability and emotional support.

Despite frequent disruptions, Bobby remains calm and solution-oriented, often relying on dry humor to manage tense situations. He is optimistic and composed under pressure. He holds no grudges against rival groups, even enjoying the Saja Boys' music while still viewing them as competition.

His dedication is deeply personal; he genuinely cares for the members of HUNTR/X. His relationship with them is familiar and trusting, and he often supports them in lighthearted ways, such as joining in their dances. However, his unassuming nature sometimes leads the girls to overlook his efforts, leaving him feeling lonely and vulnerable. This vulnerability is exploited by the demon king, Gwi-Ma, who preys on Bobby's fear of the group falling apart and being left with no sense of belonging. This suggests that Bobby may have few personal relationships outside of his work.

### **4. Plot**

Bobby first appears backstage at a HUNTR/X concert, panicking when he realizes the girls are late. He is relieved when they make a spectacular skydiving entrance. After their successful show, he offers them a vacation, which they decline, suggesting he go instead.

When HUNTR/X releases their single "Golden" ahead of schedule, Bobby is thrilled by its instant success and pushes for immediate promotions. He grows worried when Rumi's voice falters during rehearsal and becomes overwhelmed by the fallout from her disappearance.

He is the one to inform the girls about the Saja Boys' viral debut and later confidently prepares for a HUNTR/X fan event, only to be surprised by the Saja Boys' arrival. The night before the Idol Awards, he tries to cheer up the arguing members with snacks, but they leave before he can, leaving him disheartened. At that moment, he receives an invitation to join the Saja Boys' fandom.

On the day of the awards, he is concerned when demons disguised as Mira and Zoey hijack Rumi's performance. After HUNTR/X's public breakup, a devastated Bobby is targeted by Gwi-Ma's whispers. Feeling that he has failed and is now alone, he falls into a trance and attends the Saja Boys' concert.

However, when the real Rumi returns and sings "What It Sounds Like," Bobby is one of the first to break free from the hypnosis. As HUNTR/X reunites and defeats the demons, he proudly declares, "I love my girls."
