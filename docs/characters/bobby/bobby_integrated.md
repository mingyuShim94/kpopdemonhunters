## 📖 Story

Bobby is introduced as the fiercely loyal manager of HUNTR/X, a man whose top priority is the well-being and success of his group. He is completely oblivious to the world of demons, believing the supernatural events surrounding the girls are just special effects or publicity stunts. This innocence provides a comedic contrast to the life-or-death battles HUNTR/X faces; for instance, while the girls fight for their lives amid a collapsing Honmoon (spirit gate), Bobby casually remarks on the peaceful scenery, thinking the chaos is just part of a show.

Despite the constant trouble the girls get into—disappearing suddenly, showing up late, or even canceling shows—Bobby never blames them. Instead, he takes full responsibility, handling the fallout with a simple motto: "Well, this is what I get paid to do." He is shown to be deeply caring, putting the members' needs above his own. When the group forgoes a luxury resort vacation he had booked for them, they gift it to him, acknowledging his hard work. However, when Rumi decides to release a new single, Bobby immediately gives up his vacation to support them, showing his dedication.

His importance to the group is such that he becomes a prime target for their enemies. In a climactic scene, a demon impersonates Bobby and pretends to be taken hostage, luring Mira and Zoey into a trap. Because they care for him so deeply, and with only seconds to spare before a performance, they fall for the ruse without question.

Bobby also shows an unbiased love for all idols, not just HUNTR/X. He is briefly mesmerized by the rival group, the **Saja Boys**, and is seen enjoying their music and carrying their merchandise. This isn't a sign of disloyalty but rather a reflection of his genuine appreciation for the entire K-pop industry. He welcomes the Saja Boys warmly even when they crash a HUNTR/X fan event, further proving his good nature.
