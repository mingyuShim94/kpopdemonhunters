### **1. Overview**

Baby Saja is the main rapper of the Saja Boys and serves as a minor antagonist in the film _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is a demon who disguises himself as a K-pop idol to steal fans from the demon-hunting girl group HUNTR/X as part of a plan to weaken the protective Honmoon barrier. His rapping voice is provided by Danny Chung.

### **2. Appearance**

Baby is a slim man of average height with a boyish appearance, a short, round face, a small nose, and soft lips. In his human disguise, he has pale skin, fluffy turquoise hair styled in a mop top, and matching turquoise eyes. He paints his nails mint green. In his demon form, he has purple skin with glowing patterns, clawed hands, sharp teeth, and golden eyes.

As an idol, Baby dresses in a youthful style, often wearing newsboy caps backwards and oversized sweaters. In his true demon form, he wears a tattered black _hanbok_ and a _gat_. During the "Your Idol" performance, he blends these styles, wearing a turtleneck under a traditional overcoat.

### **3. Personality**

As the group's _maknae_ (youngest member), Baby is portrayed as the most youthful member of the Saja Boys. On stage, he plays up a cute, boyish persona by wearing oversized clothing, using playful gestures, and displaying an oral fixation with childish props like lollipops. Unlike the other members, he avoids "ship teases" with fans, which reinforces his innocent image. However, when he raps, his presence becomes powerful and commanding.

Despite this boyish image, Baby is an immoral demon who willingly serves Gwi-Ma. Off-stage, he drops the act and appears bored, nonchalant, and tired of maintaining his idol persona. Like the other Saja Boys, he becomes aggressive when their plans start to fail and is genuinely shocked when Jinu sacrifices himself for Rumi.

### **4. Plot**

**Backstory:** Little is known about Baby's early life. It is assumed that he was once human and was transformed into a demon after making a deal with the demon king, Gwi-Ma.

**Main Events:** Baby first appears in the Demon Realm when Jinu proposes the plan to form a K-pop boy band. As a member of the Saja Boys, he makes his debut in the human world and quickly gains popularity. He competes on a variety show, effortlessly winning a hot sauce drinking contest and finishing with the phrase, "goo goo ga ga."

During a joint fan signing event, Baby sits between Zoey and Jinu and keeps to himself, drinking water. Like the other members, he discards fan gifts in the trash after the event.

In his final appearance, Baby performs "Your Idol" in his demon form. When HUNTR/X reunites, he attacks the girls and engages in a brief fight with Zoey. He is visibly shocked by Jinu's betrayal and subsequent sacrifice. His ultimate fate is not explicitly shown, leaving his status unknown.

### **5. Abilities and Skills**

- **Demonic Powers:** As a demon, Baby can steal souls, teleport, levitate, and shapeshift between his human and demon forms.
- **Immortality:** He is effectively immortal, unless killed by a demon hunter or Gwi-Ma.
- **Rapping:** As the main rapper, he is exceptionally skilled.
- **High Spice Tolerance:** He can handle extreme levels of spice, as proven when he easily won the hot sauce challenge.
- **Artistic Talents:** He is a proficient dancer and singer.

### **6. Quotes**

- "Goo goo ga ga." — Baby, after winning the spice contest.
