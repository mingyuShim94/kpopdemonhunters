## 📖 Story

Little is known about Baby Saja’s human life. Unlike the group's leader, Jinu, he never speaks of his past. Fan theories, based on Korean folklore, suggest he may be a **Taesin** (태자귀), the ghost of a child who died young, which would explain his name and childlike features. This theory is supported by his constant eating, which connects to tales of Taesin being created by starving a child to heighten its desire for food, thus making it a powerful, greedy spirit.

As a member of the **Saja Boys**, Baby is a loyal servant of the Demon King, Gwi-Ma. He uses his innocent and cute image as a weapon, lulling fans into a false sense of security before stealing their souls. On stage, he plays up the “baby” persona with pouts and charming gestures. Off stage, he is cold, cunning, and sarcastic, with a deadpan sense of humor. He is fiercely competitive, especially noted for his high tolerance for spicy food, which he wins in a variety show challenge against the members of **HUNTR/X**.

While the other members of the Saja Boys have clear rivalries or romantic tensions with the members of HUNTR/X, Baby remains pointedly disconnected, making him an outlier in the group dynamic. He is ultimately defeated with the rest of the Saja Boys, though his final moments are not explicitly shown on screen.

*   In fan works, he is often depicted as a solo character, as he is the only member of the Saja Boys without a clear romantic link to a member of HUNTR/X.
