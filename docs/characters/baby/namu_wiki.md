### **1. Overview**

> "Googoo gaga."

Baby is a character in _K-Pop Demon Hunters_. He is the main rapper for the demon idol group, Saja Boys. With his mint-green hair and boyish good looks, he serves as the group's _maknae_ (youngest member), a role he shares with Zoey in the rival group HUNTR/X.

Fans have praised the "gap moe" (a charm arising from contrast) of his character: a cute, baby-faced appearance paired with a deep, baritone rapping voice.

### **2. In-Story Arc**

Reflecting his stage name, "Baby," he has the fewest lines of dialogue in the group. While he isn't deeply involved in the main plot's ships, he is sometimes included in a "Mystery-Zoey-Baby" love triangle and is occasionally depicted in fan works as the child of Mystery and Zoey.

Despite his minimal dialogue, he receives several memorable moments. He wins a spicy food challenge on a variety show and, as the group's rapper, gets impressive solo shots in every song. Notably, his solo rap in "Your Idol" coincides with the dramatic descent of the demon king, Gwi-ma, giving him a key part in the film's climax.

He is also shown performing idol fanservice, like making a "cheek heart" for a fan who gives him a bouquet. In a parody of the variety show _Weekly Idol_, he is seen getting a piggyback ride from his bandmate Abby as they flee from HUNTR/X.

Like his bandmate Romance, Baby's final fate is not explicitly shown on screen; he is simply omitted from the final battle.

### **3. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **Occult Motif:** His demonic motif is believed to be the _Taeja-gwi_, the ghost of a child, specifically one created through the dark ritual of _Yeommae_, where a starved child is killed to create a powerful spirit. This theory is supported by his frequent on-screen eating, his "baby" concept, and his mint-green hair (green being associated with the bamboo tube used in the ritual).

- **High Spice Tolerance:** He is incredibly good at handling spicy food, calmly winning a spicy sauce challenge while his bandmates were in agony.

- **Growing Popularity:** Despite his limited screen time and having only one line of dialogue ("Googoo gaga"), his popularity has grown to rival even Jinu's. Fans are drawn to his "gap moe" appeal: the cute, mint-haired _maknae_ with a chic personality, a professional on-stage persona, and a deep rapping voice. Because his fate was left ambiguous, many fans hope for his return in a sequel.

- **Animation Details:** The animator for Baby's rap scene in "Your Idol" studied K-pop music show camera work but created the movements without a specific video reference, instead getting feedback from his K-pop-loving fianc√©e to ensure it looked "hot."

- **Design Inspiration:** The character designer, Marion Bordeyne, confirmed that Baby's design was inspired by **Jimin of BTS**. This news became a hot topic among K-pop fans, who drew comparisons between the two.

- **Group Hierarchy:** Despite being the _maknae_, Baby is not the shortest member of the group; character model sheets show that Mystery is slightly shorter.

- **Fan Works:** In fan creations, he is often depicted in various scenarios, including solo art, as part of the Mystery-Zoey-Baby love triangle, or even in a humorous "Abby x Baby" pairing (playing on the Korean meaning of "Abby" as "father").

- **Voice Actor:** Danny Chung is the only voice actor for the Saja Boys who performs both the character's speaking and singing parts.
