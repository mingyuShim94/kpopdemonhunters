Baby Saja is a supporting antagonist in **_K-Pop Demon Hunters_**. He is the main rapper and **_maknae_** (youngest member) of the demon idol group, Saja Boys. His mission, along with his bandmates, is to steal fans from the hunter group HUNTR/X to weaken the protective Honmoon barrier.

He is well-loved by fans for his "gap moe"—the charming contrast between his cute, boyish appearance and his deep, baritone rapping voice.

### **2. Appearance and Personality**

Baby has a youthful, boyish face with fluffy, mint-green hair and matching turquoise eyes. On stage, he leans into his _maknae_ concept, wearing oversized sweaters and newsboy caps and using childish props like lollipops to project an innocent image. However, this is a carefully crafted persona. When he raps, his presence becomes powerful and commanding.

Off-stage, he drops the act and appears bored, indifferent, and weary of his idol duties. Like his fellow demons, he is aggressive when provoked and is genuinely shocked by Jinu's sacrifice.

### **3. In-Story Arc**

**Backstory:** While his past is largely unknown, it is assumed that he was once human and became a demon through a pact with Gwi-ma.

**Present:** Baby is introduced as a member of the newly formed Saja Boys. He makes a strong impression on a variety show by effortlessly winning a spicy food challenge, finishing with a deadpan "Googoo gaga."

At a joint fan signing event, he maintains his professional idol persona, giving a fan a "cheek heart" when receiving a bouquet. However, like the other members, he immediately discards the fan gifts once out of sight.

His most significant on-stage moment is during the performance of "Your Idol," where his solo rap verse is timed with the dramatic descent of the demon king, Gwi-ma. In the final battle, he briefly fights Zoey and is visibly stunned by Jinu's betrayal. His ultimate fate is not shown on screen, leaving his status ambiguous.

### **4. Abilities and Skills**

- **Demonic Powers:** He possesses standard demon abilities, including soul stealing, teleportation, levitation, and shapeshifting.
- **Immortality:** He is effectively immortal unless killed by a hunter or Gwi-ma.
- **Rapping:** As the main rapper, he is exceptionally skilled.
- **High Spice Tolerance:** He has a superhuman ability to handle extremely spicy food.

### **5. Miscellaneous & Trivia**

- **Occult Motif:** His demonic motif is believed to be the **_Yeommae_**, a spirit from Korean folklore created through a dark ritual involving the starvation and death of a child. This theory is supported by his "baby" concept and his frequent on-screen eating.
- **Design Inspiration:** His character design was inspired by **Jimin of BTS**. Fans have also noted a resemblance to **Hyunjin of Stray Kids**.
- **Voice Actor:** Danny Chung is the only Saja Boys member whose voice actor performs both the speaking and singing parts. His only line of dialogue is "Googoo gaga."
- **Popularity:** Despite his minimal screen time, his unique "gap moe" charm has made him a breakout star, with his popularity growing to rival even Jinu's. Because his fate is unknown, many fans hope he will return in a sequel.
- **Symbolism:** His character can be interpreted as a symbol of the **infantilization** of K-pop idols.
- **Fan Culture:** While not part of a canonical ship, he is sometimes depicted in fan works with Zoey or as the child of Zoey and Mystery. His name is also used in playful "Abby x Baby" (father/baby) jokes.
- **Physicality:** Although he is the _maknae_, official model sheets show that he is slightly taller than his bandmate Mystery.
- **Anagram:** His name, Baby, is an anagram of his teammate's name, Abby.
