## üìñ Story

Suzie is always seen alongside Derpy, acting as the brains of the duo. While Derpy gets into clumsy antics, Suzie watches with a look of exasperation, highlighting her superior intelligence. She wears a *gat* (a traditional Korean hat) that, according to supplementary materials, she stole from Jinu, who had originally made it for Derpy. The hat fits her perfectly, adding to her distinct and slightly mischievous character.

Her name is officially recognized as both **Suzie** and **Sussie**. The nickname **"Seo-ssi" (ÏÑúÏî®)**, which sounds like "Mr. Seo" in Korean, is a pun on her perpetually "suspicious eyes" or "sus eye." The creators have confirmed that both pronunciations are correct.

Unlike most characters in the film, Suzie's design has no direct precedent in Korean or East Asian mythology. While the tiger-magpie folk painting (*kkachi horangi*) inspired the duo, the magpie in those paintings is typically realistic. The creators gave Suzie six vertically-stacked eyes and sharp teeth to give her a more supernatural, spirit-like appearance, distinguishing her from a normal bird.

## ‚ú® Trivia

*   Her most famous feature is her three pairs of vertical eyes, which fans noted resemble the triple-camera array on a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. This earned her the nickname **"Galaxy Magpie."**
*   The fan nickname became so popular that it led to an official collaboration with Samsung, where Suzie was featured in a promotional short for the **Galaxy Unpacked event in July 2025**.
*   She is the only major character whose design is a complete original, not based on any existing myth or legend.
*   The *gat* she wears was originally intended for Derpy, but she snatched it for herself, which is shown in a drawing where she is smirking.
